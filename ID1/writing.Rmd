(Smith Campus Center 148)    The Pomona College Writing Center offers free, one-on-one consultations to all students enrolled in Pomona College courses. Our mission is to provide an inclusive and collaborative space for students to talk about their writing projects and processes. We welcome all kinds of writing, including academic, creative, professional, and personal, in all stages of development, from brainstorming to the final draft. Our aim is to center students’ voices and goals as they navigate varying expectations of writing across genres. The Writing Partners are Pomona students—sophomores, juniors, and seniors—majoring in disciplines as varied as Biology, Spanish, and History. They are trained to work with writers at all levels, and on work in any area. Multilingual Specialist Jenny Thomas is also available at the Writing Center, to work with international and multilingual students on navigating writing and other forms of communication in the US academic context; stop by or make an appointment - look for 'Multilingual Specialist' on the scheduler. Consultations are available by appointment, which students can make online at writing.pomona.edu The Writing Center also offers drop-in hours Sundays through Thursdays from 8-10pm.
