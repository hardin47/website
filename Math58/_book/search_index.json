The notes are based extensively on “Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation” by Diez, Barr, and etinkaya-Rundel (Diez, Barr, and Çetinkaya-Rundel 2014). We will also be using many examples (and applets) from “Investigating Statistics, Concepts, Applications, and Methods” by Chance and Rossman (Chance and Rossman 2018). You are responsible for reading the relevant chapters in the text. The text is very good &amp; readable, so you should use it. Also, you will have a much deeper understanding of the material if you spend time working through the applets at http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/files.html. You should make sure you are coming to class and also reading the materials associated with the activities.
