# Class Information {.unnumbered}

Class notes for Math 58(B) at Pomona College: Introduction to (Bio)Statistics. The notes are based extensively on "Introduction to Modern Statistics" by Çetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin [@ims]. We will also be using many examples (and applets) from "Investigating Statistics, Concepts, Applications, and Methods" by Chance and Rossman [@iscam].

You are responsible for reading the relevant chapters in the text.  You will have a much deeper understanding of the material if you spend time working through the <a href = "https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/index2021.html" target = "_blank">online applets</a>. You should make sure you are coming to class and also reading the materials associated with the activities.

More information and course details can be found at the <a href = "https://m58-intro-stats.netlify.app/" target = "_blank">Math58B website</a>.
