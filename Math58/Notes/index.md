# Class Information {-}

Class notes for Math 58(B) at Pomona College: Introduction to (Bio)Statistics.  The notes are based extensively on "Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation" by Diez, Barr, and \c{C}etinkaya-Rundel [@isrs].  We will also be using many examples (and applets) from "Investigating Statistics, Concepts, Applications, and Methods" by Chance and Rossman [@iscam].


You are responsible for reading the relevant chapters in the text.  The text is very good & readable, so you should use it.  Also, you will have a much deeper understanding of the material if you spend time working through the applets at http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/files.html.  You should make sure you are coming to class and also reading the materials associated with the activities.
