Training Students Extract Value Big Data: Summary Workshop. Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2014.]Duncan Temple Lang began listing core concepts data science - items need taught: statistics machine learning, computing technologies, domain knowledge problem. stressed importance interpretation reasoning - methods - addressing data. Students work data science broad set skills - including knowledge randomness uncertainty, statistical methods, programming, technology - practical experience . Students tend computing statistics classes entering graduate school domain science.Temple Lang described data analysis pipeline, outlining steps one example data analysis exploration process:Asking general question.Refining question, identifying data, understanding data metadata. Temple Lang noted data used usually collected specific question hand, original experiment data set understood.Access data. unrelated science require computational skill.Transforming data structures.Exploratory data analyses understand data determine whether results scale.critical step; Temple Lang noted 80 percent data scientist’s time can spent cleaning preparing data.\n6.

Temple Lang indicated quantifying uncertainty statistical techniques important understanding interpreting models results.\n10. Conveying results.Temple Lang stressed data analysis process highly interactive iterative requires presence human loop. next step data processing often clear results current step clear, often something unexpected uncovered. also emphasized importance abstract skills concepts said people need exposed authentic data analyses, methods used. Data scientists also need statistical understanding, Temple Lang described statistical concepts taught student:Mapping general question statistical framework.Understanding scope inference, sampling, biases, limitations.Exploratory data analyses, including missing values, data quality, cleaning, matching, fusing.Understanding randomness, variability, uncertainty. Temple Lang noted many\nstudents understand sampling variability.Conditional dependence heterogeneity.Dimension reduction, variable selection, sparsity.Spurious relationships multiple testing.Parameter estimation versus “black box” prediction classification.Diagnostics, residuals, comparing models.Quantifying uncertainty model.Sampling structure dependence data reduction. Temple Lang noted modeling data becomes complicated variables independent, identically distributed.Statistical accuracy versus computational complexity efficiency.Temple Lang briefly discussed practical aspects computing, including following:Accessing data.Manipulating raw data.Data structures storage, including correlated data.Visualization stages (particularly exploratory data analyses conveying results).Parallel computing, can challenging new student.Translating high-level descriptions optimal programs.discussion, Temple Lang proposed computing statistics visualizations examine data rigorously statistical automated way. explained “scagnostics” (scatter plot diagnostics) data analysis technique graphically exploring relationships among variables. small set statistical measures can characterize scatter plots, exploratory data analysis can conducted residuals.
