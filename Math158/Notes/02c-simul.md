## <i class="fas fa-lightbulb" target="_blank"></i> Reflection Questions

1. Why do simultaneous CIs worry us (from an error perspective)?
2. What is the difference between Bonferroni, Working-Hotelling, and Scheff{\' e} adjustments?
3. When are Bonferroni intervals larger than the other two?  When are they smaller?
4. Why do we say the Bonferroni procedure is more general than other multiple comparisons procedures?
5. What does it mean for one of the adjustments to be "conservative"?
6. If $g$ is very large, why is the Working-Hotelling procedure preferred to the Bonferroni?

Note that sections 4.6 (Inverse Predictions) and 4.7 (Choice of $x$ values) provide additional information into good model building.  The sections are worth reading on your own.
