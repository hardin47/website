We’ll be sure to keep in mind: Careful presentation of data Consideration of variability Meaningful comparisons to be able to critically evaluate the medical literature with respect to design, analysis, and interpretation of results. to understand the role of inherent variability and keep it in perspective when inferring results to a population. to critically evaluate medical results given in the mainstream media. to read published studies with skepticism. Some people (in all fields!) wrongly believe that all studies published in a peer review publication must be 100% accurate and/or well designed studies. In this course, you will learn the tools to recognize, interpret, and critique statistical results in medical literature. Probability vs. Statistics 1.2 Using R Much work will be done in R using RStudio as a front end. You will need to either download R and RStudio (both are free) onto your own computer or use them on Pomona’s server. You may use R on the Pomona server: https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/ (All Pomona students will be able to log in immediately. Non-Pomona students need to go to ITS at Pomona to get Pomona login information.) If you want to use R on your own machine, you may. Please make sure all components are updated: R is freely available at http://www.r-project.org/ and is already installed on college computers. Additionally, installing R Studio is required http://rstudio.org/. http://swirlstats.com/ is a great way to walk through learning the basics of R. All computing assignments should be turned in using R Markdown compiled to pdf. Taken from Modern Drive: An introduction to statistical and data sciences via R, by Ismay and Kim, https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/ Image credit: Jessica Ward, https://jkrward.github.io/, PhD student at Newcastle University Experimental Design In this class we’ll talk about techniques used to analyze data from medical studies. Along with the computational methods, however, we’ll continue to think about issues of experimental design and interpretation. Descriptive statistics describe the sample at hand with no intent on making generalizations. Inferential statistics use a sample to make claims about a population Simple Random Sample is an unbiased sample. Sample is selected in such a way that every possible sample of size \\(n\\) is equally likely. Blind / double blind when the patient and/or doctor do not know which patient is receiving which treatment.

It can happen because of poor sampling or poor experimental conditions. Surgery Timing The study, “Operation Timing and 30-Day Mortality After Elective General Surgery”, tested the hypotheses that the risk of 30-day mortality associated with elective general surgery: 1) increases from morning to evening throughout the routine workday; 2) increases from Monday to Friday through the workweek; and 3) is more frequent in July and August than during other months of the year. As a presumed negative control, the investigators also evaluated mortality as a function of the phase of the moon. Secondarily, they evaluated these hypotheses as they pertain to a composite in-hospital morbidity endpoint. The related data set contains 32,001 elective general surgical patients. Age, gender, race, BMI, several comorbidities, several surgical risk indices, the surgical timing predictors (hour, day of week, month,moon phase) and the outcomes (30-day mortality and in-hosptial complication) are provided. The dataset is cleaned and complete (no missing data except for BMI). There are no outliers or data problems. The data are from (Sessler et al. 2011) Note that in the example, mortality rates are compared for patients electing to have surgery in July vs August. We’d like to compare the average age of the participants from the July group to the August group. Even if the mortality difference is significant, we can’t conclude causation because it was an observational study. However, the more similar the groups are based on clinical variables, the more likely any differences in mortality are due to timing. How different are the groups based on clinical variables? surgeryurl &lt;- url(&quot;https://www.causeweb.org/tshs/datasets/surgery_timing.Rdata&quot;) load(surgeryurl) surgery &lt;- stata_data surgery %&gt;% dplyr::filter(month %in% c(&quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(month) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize(agemean = mean(age, na.rm=TRUE), agesd = sd(age, na.rm=TRUE), agen = sum(!is.na(age))) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## month agemean agesd agen ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Aug 58.1 15.2 3176 ## 2 Jul 57.6 15.5 2325 2.1 t-test (book: 2.1) A t-test is a test of means. For the surgery timing data, the groups would ideally have similar age distributions. Why? What are the advantages and disadvantages of running a retrospective cohort study? The two-sample t-test starts with the assumption that the population means of the two groups are equal, \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\). The sample means \\(\\overline{y}_1\\) and \\(\\overline{y}_2\\) will always be different. How different must the \\(\\overline{y}\\) values be in order to reject the null hypothesis? Definition 2.1 (Model 1) \\[\\begin{align} y_{1j} &amp;= \\mu_{1} + \\epsilon_{1j} \\ \\ \\ \\ j=1, 2, \\ldots, n_1\\\\ y_{2j} &amp;= \\mu_{2} + \\epsilon_{2j} \\ \\ \\ \\ j=1, 2, \\ldots, n_2\\\\ \\epsilon_{ij} &amp;\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\\\ E[Y_i] &amp;= \\mu_i \\end{align}\\] That is, we are assuming that for each group the true population average is fixed and an individual that is randomly selected will have some amount of random error away from the true population mean. Note that we have assumed that the variances of the two groups are equal. We have also assumed that there is independence between and within the groups. Note: we will assume the population variances are equal if neither sample variance is more than twice as big as the other. Example1 Are the mean ages of the July vs August patients statistically different? (why two sided?) \\[\\begin{align} H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\\\ H_1: \\mu_1 \\ne \\mu_2 \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} t &amp;= \\frac{(\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2) - 0}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\\\ s_p &amp;= \\sqrt{ \\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1) s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}}\\\\ df &amp;= n_1 + n_2 -2\\\\ &amp;\\\\ t &amp;= \\frac{(58.05 - 57.57) - 0}{15.34 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3176} + \\frac{1}{2325}}}\\\\ &amp;= 1.15\\\\ s_p &amp;= \\sqrt{ \\frac{(3176-1)15.22^2 + (2325-1) 15.5^2}{3176 + 2325 -2}}\\\\ &amp;= 15.34\\\\ df &amp;= n_1 + n_2 -2\\\\ &amp;= 5499\\\\ \\mbox{p-value} &amp;= 2 \\cdot (1-pt(1.15,5499)) = 0.25\\\\ \\end{align}\\] The same analysis can be done in R (with and without tydying the output): surgery %&gt;% dplyr::filter(month %in% c(&quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;)) %&gt;% t.test(age ~ month, data = .) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: age by month ## t = 1.1585, df = 4954.5, p-value = 0.2467 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.3366687 1.3092918 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Aug mean in group Jul ## 58.05220 57.56589 surgery %&gt;% dplyr::filter(month %in% c(&quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;)) %&gt;% t.test(age ~ month, data = .) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 1 x 10 ## estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.486 58.1 57.6 1.16 0.247 4954. -0.337 ## # … with 3 more variables: conf.high &lt;dbl&gt;, method &lt;chr&gt;, ## # alternative &lt;chr&gt; Look at SD and SEM What is the statistic?

Consider the brief video from the movie Slacker, an early movie by Richard Linklater (director of Boyhood, School of Rock, Before Sunrise, etc.). You can view the video here from starting at 2:22 and ending at 4:30: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-U_I1DCGEY] In the video, a rider in the back of a taxi (played by Linklater himself) muses about alternate realities that could have happened as he arrived in Austin on the bus. What if instead of taking a taxi, he had found a ride with a woman at the bus station? He could have take a different road into a different alternate reality, and in that reality his current reality would be an alternate reality. And so on. What is the point? Why watch the video? How does it relate the to the material from class? What is the relationship to sampling distributions? [Thanks to Ben Baumer at Smith College for the pointer to the specific video.] ANOVA Skip ANOVA in your text (2.4 and part of 2.9) 2.2 Simple Linear Regression (book: 2.3) Simple Linear Regression is a model (hopefully discussed in introductory statistics) used for describing a {linear} relationship between two variables. It typically has the form of: \\[\\begin{align} y_i &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i \\ \\ \\ \\ i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\\\ \\epsilon_i &amp;\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\\\ E(Y|x) &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\end{align}\\] For this model, the deterministic component (\\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\)) is a linear function of the two parameters, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), and the explanatory variable \\(x\\). The random error terms, \\(\\epsilon_i\\), are assumed to be independent and to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). How can we use this model to describe the two sample means case we discussed on the esophageal data? Consider \\(x\\) to be a dummy variable that takes on the value 0 if the observation is a control and 1 if the observation is a case. Assume we have \\(n_1\\) controls and \\(n_2\\) cases. It turns out that, coded in this way, the regression model and the two-sample t-test model are mathematically equivalent! (For the color game, the natural way to code is 1 for the color distracter and 0 for the standard game. Why?) \\[\\begin{align} \\mu_1 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (0) = \\beta_0 \\\\ \\mu_2 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\\\ \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 &amp;= \\beta_1 \\end{align}\\] Why are they the same? \\[\\begin{align} b_1= \\hat{\\beta}_1 &amp;= \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - \\sum x_i \\sum y_i}{n \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i )^2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n \\sum_2 y_i - n_2 \\sum y_i}{(n n_2-n_2^2)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{ n \\sum_2 y_i - n_2 (\\sum_1 y_i + \\sum_2 y_i)}{n_2(n-n_2)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(n_1 + n_2) \\sum_2 y_i - n_2 \\sum_1 y_i - n_2 \\sum_2 y_i}{n_1 n_2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n_1 \\sum_2 y_i - n_2 \\sum_1 y_i}{n_1 n_2}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n_1 n_2 \\overline{y}_2 - n_2 n_1 \\overline{y}_1}{n_1 n_2}\\\\ &amp;= \\overline{y}_2 - \\overline{y}_1\\\\ b_0 = \\hat{\\beta}_0 &amp;= \\frac{\\sum y_i - b_1 \\sum x_i}{n}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_1 y_i + \\sum_2 y_i - b_1 n_2}{n}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n_1 \\overline{y}_1 + n_2 \\overline{y}_2 - n_2 \\overline{y}_2 + n_2 \\overline{y}_1}{n}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n \\overline{y}_1 + n_2 \\overline{y}_2 - n_2 \\overline{y}_2 + n_2 \\overline{y}_1}{n}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n \\overline{y}_1}{n} = \\overline{y}_1 \\end{align}\\] Definition 2.2 (Model 2) \\[\\begin{align} y_{i} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i \\ \\ \\ \\ i=1, 2, \\ldots, n\\\\ \\epsilon_{i} &amp;\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\\\ E[Y_i] &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\\\ \\hat{y}_i &amp;= b_0 + b_1 x_i \\end{align}\\] That is, we are assuming that for each observation the true population average is fixed and an individual that is randomly selected will have some amount of random error away from the true population mean at their value for the explanatory variable, \\(x_i\\). Note that we have assumed that the variance is constant across any level of the explanatory variable. We have also assumed that there is independence across individuals. [Note: there are no assumptions about the distribution of the explanatory variable, \\(X\\)]. What are the similarities in the t-test vs. SLR models? predicting average assuming independent, constant errors errors follow a normal distribution with zero mean and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) What are the differences in the two models? one subscript versus two (or similarly, two models for the t-test) two samples for the t-test (two variables for the regression… or is that a similarity??) both variables are quantitative in SLR 2.3 Confidence Intervals (section 2.11) [http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/NewConfsim/Confsim.html] In general, the format of a confidence interval is (INTERPRETATION!!!!): estimate +/- critical value x standard error of the estimate Age data: \\[\\begin{align} 90\\% \\mbox{ CI for } \\mu_1: &amp; \\overline{y}_1 \\pm t^*_{3176-1} \\times \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\overline{y}_1}\\\\ &amp; 58.05 \\pm 1.645 \\times 15.22/\\sqrt{3176}\\\\ &amp; (57.61, 58.49)\\\\ 95\\% \\mbox{ CI for }\\mu_1 - \\mu_2: &amp; \\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2 \\pm t^*_{5499} s_p \\sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}\\\\ &amp; 0.48 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.42\\\\ &amp; (-0.34, 1.30) \\end{align}\\] Note the CI on pgs 54/55, there is a typo. The correct interval for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) for the games data should be: \\[\\begin{align} 95\\% \\mbox{ CI for } \\mu_1 - \\mu_2: &amp; \\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2 \\pm t^*_{38} \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2}\\\\ &amp; \\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2 \\pm t^*_{38} s_p \\sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}\\\\ &amp; 38.1 - 35.55 \\pm 2.02 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{(19)3.65^2 + (19)3.39^2}{20+20-2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{20}}\\\\ &amp; (0.29 s, 4.81 s) \\end{align}\\] 2.4 Random Sample vs. Random allocation Recall what you’ve learned about how good random samples lead to inference about a population. On the other hand, in order to make a causal conclusion, you need a randomized experiment with random allocation of the treatments (impossible to happen in many settings). Random sampling and random allocation are DIFFERENT ideas that should be clear in your mind.

["SLR.html", "Chapter 3 Simple Linear Regression 3.1 Transformations 3.2 Fitting the regression line 3.3 Correlation 3.4 Errors 3.5 Intervals 3.6 R Example (SLR): Happy Planet", " Chapter 3 Simple Linear Regression Though we’ve discussed the relationship between tests of means and simple linear regression, we will really consider simple linear regression in a much broader context (one where both the explanatory and response variables are quantitative). The data below represents 10 different variables on health of a country measured on 143 countries. Data taken from (R. Lock et al. 2016), originally from the Happy Planet Index Project [http://www.happyplanetindex.org/]. Region of the world is coded as 1 = Latin America, 2 = Western nations, 3 = Middle East, 4 = Sub-Saharan Africa, 5 = South Asia, 6 = East Asia, 7 = former Communist countries. We are going to investigate happiness and life expectancy. 3.1 Transformations Model assumptions The average value for the response variable is a linear function of the explanatory variable. The error terms follow a normal distribution around the linear model. The error terms have a mean of zero. The error terms have a constant variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\). The error terms are independent (and identically distributed). [http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/RegSim/RegCoeff.html] How do we tell whether the assumptions are met? We can’t always. But it’s good to look at plots: scatter plot, residual plot, histograms of residuals. We denote the residuals for this model as: \\[\\begin{align} r_i = \\hat{e}_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\end{align}\\] Figs 3.13 and 3.15 taken from Kutner et al. (2004) important note!! The idea behind transformations is to make the model as appropriate as possible for the data at hand. We want to find the correct linear model; we want our assumptions to hold. We are not trying to find the most significant model or big \\(R^2\\). See section 2.9 in your text. No normal probability plots (qq-plots); use histograms or boxplots to assess the symmetry and normality of the residuals. 3.2 Fitting the regression line How do we fit a regression line? Find \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) that minimize the sum of squared distance of the points to the line (called ordinary least squares): \\[\\begin{align} \\min \\sum (y_i \\hat{y}_i)^2 &amp;=&amp; \\min RSS \\mbox{ residual sum of squares}\\\\ RSS &amp;=&amp; \\sum (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2\\\\ \\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial b_0} = 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial RSS}{\\partial b_1} = 0\\\\ b_0 &amp;=&amp; \\overline{y} - b_1 \\overline{x}\\\\ b_1 &amp;=&amp; r(x,y) \\frac{s_x}{s_y}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Is that the only way to find values for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)? (absolute distances, maximum likelihood,…) Resistance to outliers? What is \\(\\hat{y}\\) at \\(\\overline{x}\\)? \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{y} &amp;=&amp; b_0 + b_1 \\overline{x}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\overline{y} - b_1 \\overline{x} + b_1 \\overline{x}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\overline{y} \\end{align}\\] The regression line will always pass through the point \\((\\overline{x}, \\overline{y})\\). Definition 3.1 An estimate is unbiased if, over many repeated samples drawn from the population, the average value of the estimates based on the different samples would equal the population value of the parameter being estimated. That is, a statistic is unbiased if the mean of its sampling distribution is the population parameter. 3.3 Correlation Consider a scatterplot, you’ll have variability in both directions: \\((x_i - \\overline{x}) \\&amp; (y_i - \\overline{y})\\). \\[\\begin{align} \\mbox{sample covariance}&amp;&amp;\\\\ cov(x,y) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum (x_i - \\overline{x}) (y_i - \\overline{y})\\\\ \\mbox{sample correlation}&amp;&amp;\\\\ r(x,y) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{cov(x,y)}{s_x s_y}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (x_i - \\overline{x}) (y_i - \\overline{y})}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1} \\frac{\\sum(y_i - \\overline{y})^2}{n-1}}}\\\\ \\mbox{pop cov} &amp;=&amp; \\sigma_{xy}\\\\ \\mbox{pop cor} &amp;=&amp; \\rho = \\frac{\\sigma_{xy}}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] \\(-1 \\leq r \\leq 1 \\&amp; -1 \\leq \\rho \\leq 1\\). No Spearman’s rank correlation or Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\). \\(b_1 = r \\frac{s_y}{s_x}\\) if \\(r=0, b_1=0\\) if \\(r=1, b_1 &gt; 0\\) but can be anything! \\(r &lt; 0 \\leftrightarrow b &lt; 0, r &gt; 0 \\leftrightarrow b &gt; 0\\) Recall that \\(R^2\\) is the proportion of variability explained by the line. 3.4 Errors Recall, \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). How do we estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\)? \\[\\begin{align} RSS &amp;=&amp; \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ residual sum of squares}\\\\ MSS &amp;=&amp; \\sum (\\hat{y}_i - \\overline{y})^2 \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ model sum of squares}\\\\ TSS &amp;=&amp; \\sum (y_i - \\overline{y})^2 \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ total sum of squares}\\\\ s_{y|x}^2 &amp;=&amp; \\hat{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{1}{n-2} RSS\\\\ s_x^2 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\\\ s_y^2 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (y_i - \\overline{y})^2\\\\ var(\\epsilon) &amp;=&amp; s_{y|x}^2 = \\frac{RSS}{n-2} = \\frac{\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2} = SE(\\epsilon)\\\\ var(b_1) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{s_{y|x}^2}{(n-1) s_x^2}\\\\ SE(b_1) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{s_{y|x}}{\\sqrt{(n-1)} s_x}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2/(n-2)}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] \\(SE(b_1) \\downarrow\\) as \\(\\sigma \\downarrow\\) \\(SE(b_1) \\downarrow\\) as \\(n \\uparrow\\) \\(SE(b_1) \\downarrow\\) as \\(s_x \\uparrow\\) WHY? What do we mean by \\(SE(b_1)\\)? As we saw above, the correlation and the slope estimates are intimately related. They are also both related to the coefficient of determination. \\[\\begin{align} R^2 = r^2 = \\frac{MSS}{TSS} \\end{align}\\] \\(R^2\\) is the proportion of total variability explained by the regression line (the linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not at all correlated, \\(\\hat{y}_i \\approx \\overline{y}\\), MSS = 0, \\(R^2=0\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are perfectly correlated, \\(\\hat{y}_i = y_i\\), MSS=TSS, \\(R^2 = 1\\). 3.4.1 Testing \\(\\beta_1\\) If \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\) is true, then \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{b_1 - 0}{SE(b_1)} \\sim t_{n-2} \\end{align}\\] Note that the degrees of freedom are now \\(n-2\\) because we are estimating two parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)). We can also find a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\): \\[\\begin{align} b_1 \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} SE(b_1) \\end{align}\\] 3.5 Intervals As with anything that has some type of standard error, we can create intervals that give us some confidence in the statements we are making. 3.5.1 Confidence Intervals In general, confidence intervals are of the form: point estimate +/- multiplier * SE(point estimate) 3.5.2 Slope We can create a CI for the slope parameter, \\(\\beta_1\\): \\[\\begin{align} b_1 &amp;\\pm&amp; t_{\\alpha/2,n-2} SE(b_1)\\\\ b_1 &amp;\\pm&amp; t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} \\frac{s_{y|x}}{\\sqrt{(n-1)}s_x}\\\\ 6.693 &amp;\\pm&amp; t_{.025, 141} 0.375\\\\ t_{.025,141} &amp;=&amp; qt(0.025, 141) = -1.977\\\\ \\mbox{CI} &amp;&amp; (5.95 \\mbox{ years/unit of happy}, 7.43 \\mbox{ years/unit of happy}) \\end{align}\\] How can we interpret the CI? Does it make sense to talk about a unit of happiness? 3.5.3 Mean Response We can also create a CI for the mean response, \\(E[Y|x^*] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^*\\). Note that the standard error of the point estimate (\\(\\hat{y}=b_0 + b_1 x^*\\)) now depends on the variability associated with two things (\\(b_0, b_1\\)). \\[\\begin{align} SE(\\hat{y(x^*)}) &amp;=&amp; \\sqrt{ \\frac{s^2_{y|x}}{n} + (x^* - \\overline{x})^2 SE(b_1)^2}\\\\ SE(\\hat{y}(\\overline{x})) &amp;=&amp; s_{y|x}/\\sqrt{n}\\\\ SE(\\hat{y}(x)) &amp;\\geq&amp; s_{y|x}/\\sqrt{n} \\ \\ \\ \\forall x \\end{align}\\] How would you interpret the associated interval? 3.5.4 Prediction of an Individual Response As should be obvious, predicting an individual is more variable than predicting a mean. \\[\\begin{align} SE(y(x^*)) &amp;=&amp; \\sqrt{ \\frac{s^2_{y|x}}{n} + (x^* - \\overline{x})^2 SE(b_1)^2 + s^2_{y|x}}\\\\ SE(y(x^*)) &amp;=&amp; \\sqrt{ SE(\\hat{y}(x^*))^2 + s^2_{y|x}}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] How would you interpret the associated interval? 3.5.5 Outlying, High Leverage, and Influential Points We are skipping the rest of this section in the notes. You are not responsible for it. Read section 4.7 (no loess, ignore the multiple predictors part, ) Theorem 3.1 High leverage points are x-outliers with the potential to exert undue influence on regression coefficient estimates. Influential points are points that have exerted undue influence on the regression coefficient estimates. Note: typically we think of more data as better; more values will tend to decrease the sampling variability of our statistic. But if I give you a lot more data and put it all at \\(\\overline{x}\\), \\(SE(b_1)\\) stays exactly the same. Why?? Recall \\[\\begin{align} y_{i} &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i \\ \\ \\ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\\\ e_i &amp;=&amp; y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\end{align}\\] We plot \\(e_i\\) versus \\(\\hat{y}_i\\). (Why? Typically, we want the \\(e_i\\) to be constant at each value of \\(x_i\\). Note that \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is a simple linear transformation of \\(x_i\\), so the plot is identical.) We want to see if the distributions of the residuals is different across the fitted line (we look for patterns).\\ Not all residuals have an equal effect on the regression line!! 3.5.5.1 leverage \\[\\begin{align} h_i = \\frac{1}{n} +\\frac{(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^n (x_j - \\overline{x})^2}\\\\ \\frac{1}{n} \\leq h_i \\leq 1\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Leverage represents the effect of point \\(x_i\\) on the line. We need large leverage for a particular value to have a large effect. Note: \\[\\begin{align} SE(\\hat{y}(x_i)) &amp;=&amp; s_{y|x} \\sqrt{h_i}\\\\ SE(y(x_i)) &amp;=&amp; s_{y|x} \\sqrt{(h_i + 1)}\\\\ SE(e_i) &amp;=&amp; s_{y|x} \\sqrt{(1-h_i)}\\\\ \\hat{y}(x^*) &amp;\\pm&amp; t_{n-2, .025} (s_{y|x} \\sqrt{h(x^*)+1})\\\\ \\end{align}\\] is a 95% prediction interval at \\(x^*\\). High leverage reduces the variability because the line gets pulled toward the point. 3.5.5.2 standardized residuals \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{e_i}{s_{y|x} \\sqrt{1-h_i}} \\sim t_{n-2}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] 3.5.5.3 studentized residuals \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{e_i}{s_{y|x, (i)} \\sqrt{1-h_i}} &amp;\\sim&amp; t_{n-3}\\\\ s_{y|x, (i)} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n-3} \\sum_{j \\ne i} (y_j - \\hat{y}_{j(i)})^2 \\end{align}\\] Where do we predict 90% of residuals? \\(\\pm t_{n-2,3 , .05}\\). About \\(\\pm 2\\). 3.5.5.4 DFBETAs DFBETAs represent the change in the parameter estimate due to one observation. \\[\\begin{align} DFBETAS_i &amp;=&amp; \\frac{b_1 - b_{1(i)}}{\\frac{s_{y|x, (i)}}{\\sqrt{(n-1)} s_x}}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] 3.6 R Example (SLR): Happy Planet The data below represents 10 different variables on health of a country measured on 143 countries.

To answer the question, we will use simulation mathematical probability models. Example 4.1 Back Pain &amp; Botox, Chance and Rossman (2018), Foster et al. (2001) The randomized clinical trial examined whether the drug botulinum toxin A (Botox) is helpful for reducing pain among patients who suffer from chronic low back pain. The 31 subjects who participated in the study were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 16 received a placebo of normal saline and the other 15 received the drug itself. The subjects’ pain levels were evaluated at the beginning of the study and again after eight weeks. The researchers found that 2 of the 16 subjects who received the saline experienced a substantial reduction in pain, compared to 9 of the 15 subjects who received the actual drug. Is this an experiment or an observational study? Explain the importance of using the “placebo” treatment of saline. Create the two-way table for summarizing the data, putting the explanatory variable as the columns and the response as rows. Calculate the conditional proportions of pain reduction in the two groups. Display the results as a segmented bar graph.

Did the researchers observe more successes in the saline group than expected (if the drug had no effect) or fewer successes than expected? Is this in the direction conjectured by the researchers? Is is possible that the drug has absolutely no effect on back pain? That the differences were simply due to chance or random variability? How likely is that? Simulation 11 red “success” cards (pain reduction); 20 black “failure” cards (no pain reduction) randomly deal out (i.e. shuffle) 15 cards to the treatment group and 16 cards to the placebo group. count how many people in the treatment group were successes? Repeat 5 times. process what do the cards represent? what does shuffling the cards represent? what implicit assumption about the two groups did the shuffling of cards represent? what observational units would be represented by the dots on the dotplot? why would we count the number of repetitions with 9 or more “successes”? Repeat simulation using the two-way table applet: http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/TwowaySim/TwowaySim.html summary How many reps? How many as extreme as the true data? What proportion are at least as extreme as the true data? Do our data support the researchers conjecture? What if the actual data had been 7 successes in the treatment group (and 4 in the placebo group)? Definition 2.1 p-value The p-value is the probability of seeing our results or more extreme if there is nothing interesting going on with the data. (This is the same definition of p-value that you will always use in this class and in your own research.) Notice that regardless of whether or not the drug has an effect, the data will be different each time (think: new 31 people). The small p-value allows us to draw cause-and-effect conclusions, but doesn’t necessarily allow us to infer to a larger population. Why not? low cutoff p-value high cutoff evidence p-value \\(\\leq\\) 0.001 very strong evidence 0.001 \\(&lt;\\) p-value \\(\\leq\\) 0.01 strong evidence 0.01 \\(&lt;\\) p-value \\(\\leq\\) 0.05 moderate evidence 0.05 \\(&lt;\\) p-value \\(\\leq\\) 0.10 weak but suggestive evidence 0.10 \\(&lt;\\) p-value little or no evidence 4.2 Fisher’s Exact Test (section 6.4) Because we have a fixed sample, we can’t use the Binomial distribution to figure out associated probabilities. Instead, we use the hypergeometric distribution to enumerate the possible ways of choosing our data or more extreme given fixed row and column totals. placebo Botox pain reduction 2 = x 9 11 = n no pain reduction 14 6 20 16 = M 15 = N - M 31 = N To make it simpler, let’s say I have 5 items (N=5), and I want to choose 3 of them (n=3). How many ways can I do that? SSSNN, SSNSN, SSNNS, SNSSN, SNSNS, SNNSS, NSSSN, NSSNS, NSNSS, NNSSS [5!/ 3! 2!] (S = select, N = not selected) So, how many different ways can I select 11 people (out of 31) to be my “pain reduction” group? That is the total number of different groups of size 11 from 31. But really, we want our groups to be of a certain breakdown. We need 2 (of 16) to have gotten the placebo and 9 (of 15) to have gotten the Botox treatment. Definition 4.1 Hyp Geom Prob For any \\(2 \\times 2\\) table when there are N observations with M total successes , the probability of observing x successes in a sample of size n is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(X=x) = \\frac{\\# \\mbox{ of ways to select x successes and n-x failures}}{\\# \\mbox{ of ways to select n subjects}} = \\frac{ { M \\choose x} {N-M \\choose n-x}}{{N \\choose n}}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Find the P(X=2) We can now find EXACT probabilities associated with the following hypotheses. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp;&amp;H_0: \\pi_{pl} = \\pi_{Btx}\\\\ &amp;&amp;H_a: \\pi_{pl} &lt; \\pi_{Btx}\\\\ &amp;&amp;\\pi = \\mbox{true probability of no pain}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Is this a one- or two-sided test? Why? [Note: the assumptions here are that the row and column totals are fixed – a conditional test of independence. However, the research project in the back of chapter 6 extends the permutation test to demonstrated that the probabilities hold even under alternative technical conditions. Note also that we get an exact probability with no assumptions about sample size (we can use Fisher’s Exact Test even when true probabilities are close to 0 or 1.] 4.3 Testing independence of two categorical variables (sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.7) 4.3.1 \\(\\chi^2\\) tests (section 6.6) 2x2… but also rxc (\\(\\pi_a = \\pi_b = \\pi_c\\)) We can also use \\(\\chi^2\\) tests to evaluate \\(r \\times c\\) contingency tables. Our main question now will be whether there is an association between two categorical variables of interest. Note that we are now generalizing what we did with the Botox and back pain example. Are the two variables independent? If the two variables are independent, then the state of one variable is not related to the probability of the different outcomes of the other variable. If the data were sampled in such a way that we have random samples of both the explanatory and response variables (e.g., cross classification study), then we typically do a test of association: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: &amp;&amp; \\mbox{ the two variables are independent}\\\\ H_a: &amp;&amp; \\mbox{ the two variables are not independent} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If the data are sampled in such a way that the response is measured across specified populations (as in the example below), we typically do a test of homogeneity of proportions. For example, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: &amp;&amp; \\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3\\\\ H_a: &amp;&amp; \\mbox{not } H_0 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\pi=P(\\mbox{success})\\) for each of groups 1,2,3. How do we get expected frequencies? The same mathematics hold regardless of the type of test (i.e., sampling mechanism used to collect the data). If, in fact,the variables are independent, then we should be able to multiply their probabilities. If the probabilities are the same, we expect the overall proportion of each response variable to be the same as the proportion of the response variable in each explanatory group. And the math in the example below follows directly. Example 4.2 The table below show the observed distributions of ABO blood type in three random samples of African Americans living in different locations. The three datasets, collected in the 1950s by three different investigators, are reproduced in (Mourant, Kopec, and Domaniewsa-Sobczak 1976). Location (Florida) (Iowa) (Missouri) Total A 122 1781 353 2256 Blood B 117 1351 269 1737 Type AB 19 289 60 368 O 244 3301 713 4258 Total 502 6722 1395 8619 4.3.1.1 Test of Homogeneity of Proportions (equivalent mathematically to independence) If there is no difference in blood type proportions across the groups, then: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(AB | FL) = P(AB | IA) = P(AB | MO) = P(AB) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We will use \\(\\hat{P}(AB) = \\frac{368}{8619}\\) as baseline for expectation (under \\(H_0\\)) for all the groups. That is, we would expect, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\# \\mbox{expected for AB blood and Iowa} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{368}{8619} \\cdot 6722\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 4.3.1.2 Test of Independence (equivalent mathematically to homogeneity of proporitions) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(cond1 \\mbox{ &amp; } cond2 ) &amp;=&amp; P(cond1) P(cond2) \\mbox{ if variables 1 and 2 are independent}\\\\ P(AB \\mbox{ blood &amp; Iowa}) &amp;=&amp; P(AB \\mbox{ blood}) P(\\mbox{Iowa}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\bigg( \\frac{368}{8619}\\bigg) \\bigg( \\frac{6722}{8619} \\bigg)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.0333\\\\ \\# \\mbox{expected for AB blood and Iowa} &amp;=&amp; 0.033 \\cdot 8619\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{368 \\cdot 6722}{8619}\\\\ E_{i,j} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{(i \\mbox{ row total})(j \\mbox{ col total})}{\\mbox{grand total}}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] And the expected values under the null hypothesis… Location (Florida) (Iowa) (Missouri) Total A 131.4 1759.47 365.14 2256 Blood B 101.17 1354.69 281.14 1737 Type AB 21.43 287.00 59.56 368 O 248.00 3320.83 689.16 4258 Total 502 6722 1395 8619 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X^2 &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{all cells} \\frac{( O - E)^2}{E}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 5.65\\\\ \\mbox{p-value} &amp;=&amp; P(\\chi^2_6 \\geq 5.65) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1 - pchisq(5.65, 6)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.464 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We cannot reject the null hypothesis. Again, we have no evidence against the null hypothesis that blood types are independently distributed in the various regions. How do we know if our test statistic is a big number or not? Well, it turns out that the test statistic (\\(X^2\\)) will have an approximate \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom = \\((r- 1)\\cdot (c-1)\\). As long as: We have a random sample from the population. We expect at least 1 observation in every cell (\\(E_i \\geq 1 \\forall i\\)) We expect at least 5 observations in 80% of the cells (\\(E_i \\geq 5\\) for 80% of \\(i\\)) When there are only two populations, the \\(\\chi^2\\) procedure is equivalent to the two-sided z-test for proportions. The chi-squared test statistic is the square of the z-test statistic. That is, the chi-squared test is exactly the same as the two-sided alternative for the z-test. use chi-square if you have multiple populations use z-test if you want one-sided tests or confidence intervals. 4.4 Parameter Estimation (section 6.8) Definition 4.2 Data Types Data are often classified as Categorical - each unit is assigned to a category Quantitative - each observational unit is assigned a numerical value (Binary - a special case of categorical with 2 categories, e.g. male/female) Table 6.6 on page 193 of the textbook is excellent and worth looking at. Example 4.3 Popcorn &amp; Lung Disease Chance and Rossman (2018) How can we tell if popcorn production is related to lung disease? Consider High / Low exposure: low exposure high exposure Airway obstructed 6 15 21 Airway not obstructed 52 43 95 58 58 116 Is 21 a lot of people? Can we compare 6 vs. 15? What should we look at? proportions (always a number between 0 and 1). Look at your data (graphically and numerically). Segmented bar graph (mosaic plot): Is there a difference in the two groups? Look at the difference in proportions or risk: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} 6/58 = 0.103 &amp; 15/58=0.2586 &amp; \\Delta = 0.156\\\\ p_1 = 0.65 &amp; p_2 = 0.494 &amp; \\Delta = 0.156\\\\ p_1 = 0.001 &amp; p_2 = 0.157 &amp; \\Delta = 0.156\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] It turns out that the sampling distribution of the difference in the sample proportions (of success) across two independent groups can be modeled by the normal distribution if we have reasonably large sample sizes (CLT). To ensure the accuracy of the test, check whether np and n(1-p) is bigger than 5 in both samples is usually adequate. A more precise check is \\(n_s \\hat{p}_c\\) and \\(n_s(1-\\hat{p}_c)\\) are both greater than 5; \\(n_s\\) is the smaller of the two sample sizes and \\(\\hat{p}_c\\)is the sample proportion when the two samples are combined into one. Note: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 \\sim N\\Bigg(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_1(1-\\pi_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\pi_2(1-\\pi_2)}{n_2}}\\Bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] When testing independence, we assume that \\(\\pi_1=\\pi_2\\), so we use the pooled estimate of the proportion to calculate the SE: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{ \\hat{p}_c(1-\\hat{p}_c) \\bigg(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\bigg)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] So, when testing, the appropriate test statistic is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 - 0}{ \\sqrt{ \\hat{p}_c(1-\\hat{p}_c) (\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 4.4.1 CI for differences in proportions We can’t pool our estimate for the SE, but everything else stays the same… \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The main idea here is to determine whether two categorical variables are independent. That is, does knowledge of the value of one variable tell me something about the probability of the other variable (gender and pregnancy). We’re going to talk about two different ways to approach this problem. 4.4.2 Relative Risk Definition 4.3 Relative Risk The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risks for each group. We say, “The risk of success is RR times higher for those in group 1 compared to those in group 2.” \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{relative risk} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{risk group 1}}{\\mbox{risk group 2}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 1}}{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 2}}\\\\ \\mbox{RR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\\\ \\hat{\\mbox{RR}} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(\\hat{RR}\\) in the popcorn example is \\(\\frac{15/58}{6/58} = 2.5\\). We say, “The risk of airway obstruction is 2.5 times higher for those in high exposure group compared to those in the low exposure group.” What about sample size? baseline risk? To create confidence intervals for relative risk, we use the fact that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\ln (\\hat{RR})) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{(1 - \\hat{p}_1)}{n_1 \\hat{p}_1} + \\frac{(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2 \\hat{p}_2}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 4.4.3 Odds Ratios A related concept to risk is odds. It is often used in horse racing, where “success” is typically defined as losing. So, if the odds are 3 to 1 we would expect to lose 3/4 of the time. Definition 4.4 Odds Ratio A related concept to risk is odds. It is often used in horse racing, where “success” is typically defined as losing. So, if the odds are 3 to 1 we would expect to lose 3/4 of the time. The odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of odds for each group. We say, “The odds of success is OR times higher for those in group 1 compared to those group 2.” \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{odds} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes}}{\\mbox{proportion of failures}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{number of successes}}{\\mbox{number of failures}} = \\theta\\\\ \\hat{\\mbox{odds}} &amp;=&amp; \\hat{\\theta}\\\\ \\mbox{odds ratio} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{odds group 1}}{\\mbox{odds group 2}} \\\\ \\mbox{OR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_2} = \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}= \\frac{\\pi_1/(1-\\pi_1)}{\\pi_2/(1-\\pi_2)}\\\\ \\hat{\\mbox{OR}} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_1}{\\hat{\\theta}_2} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1/(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{\\hat{p}_2/(1-\\hat{p}_2)}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(\\hat{OR}\\) in the popcorn example is \\(\\frac{15/43}{6/52} = 3.02\\). We say, “The odds of airway obstruction are 3 times higher for those in the high exposure group compared to those in the low exposure group.” 4.4.3.1 OR is more extreme than RR Without loss of generality, assume the true \\(RR &gt; 1\\), implying \\(\\pi_1 / \\pi_2 &gt; 1\\) and \\(\\pi_1 &gt; \\pi_2\\). Note the following sequence of consequences: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} RR = \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2} &amp;&gt;&amp; 1\\\\ \\frac{1 - \\pi_1}{1 - \\pi_2} &amp;&lt;&amp; 1\\\\ \\frac{ 1 / (1 - \\pi_1)}{1 / (1 - \\pi_2)} &amp;&gt;&amp; 1\\\\ \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2} \\cdot \\frac{ 1 / (1 - \\pi_1)}{1 / (1 - \\pi_2)} &amp;&gt;&amp; \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\\\ OR &amp;&gt;&amp; RR \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 4.4.3.2 Other considerations: Observational study (who worked in each place?) Cross sectional (only one point in time) Healthy worker effect (who stayed home sick?) Explanatory variable is one that is a potential explanation for any changes (here exposure level). Response variable is the measured outcome of interest (here airway obstruction). Example 4.4 Smoking &amp; Lung Cancer Chance and Rossman (2018) After World War II, evidence began mounting that there was a link between cigarette smoking and pulmonary carcinoma (lung cancer). In the 1950s, two now classic articles were published on the subject. One of these studies was conducted in the United States by Wynder and Graham (1950). They found records from a large number (684) of patients with proven bronchiogenic carcinoma (a specific form of lung cancer) in hospitals in California, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Utah. They personally interviewed 634 of the subjects to identify their smoking habits, occupation, exposure to dust and fumes, alcohol intake, education, and cause of death of parents and siblings. Thirty-three subjects completed mailed questionnaires, and information for the other 17 was obtained from family members or close acquaintances. Of those in the study, the researchers focused on 605 male patients with the same form of lung cancer. Another 1332 hospital patients with similar age and economic distribution (including 780 males) without lung cancer were interviewed by these researchers in St. Louis and by other researchers in Boston, Cleveland, and Hines, Illinois. The following two-way table replicates the counts for the 605 male patients with the same form of cancer and for the “control-group” of 780 males. none light mod heavy heavy excessive chain \\(&lt;\\) 1/day 1-9/day 10-15/day 16-20/day 21-34/day 35\\(+\\)/day patients 8 14 61 213 187 122 controls 114 90 148 278 90 60 Given the results of the study, do you think we can generalize from the sample to the population? Explain and make it clear that you know the difference between a sample and a population. Causation? Case-control study (605 with lung cancer, 780 without… baseline rate?) Group A Group B expl = smoking status expl = lung cancer resp = lung cancer resp = smoking status If lung cancer is considered a success and no smoking is baseline: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{RR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{122/182}{8/122} = 10.22\\\\ \\hat{OR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{122/60}{8/114} = 28.9\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The risk of lung cancer is 10.22 times higher for those who smoke than for those who don’t smoke. The odds of lung cancer is 28.9 times higher for those who smoke than for those who don’t smoke. If chain smoking is considered a success and healthy is baseline: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{RR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{122/130}{60/174} = 2.7\\\\ \\hat{OR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{122/8}{60/114} = 28.9\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The risk of smoking is 2.7 times higher for those who have lung cancer than for those who don’t have lung cancer. The odds of smoking is 28.9 times higher for those who have lung cancer than for those who don’t have lung cancer. We know the risk of being a light smoker if you have lung cancer but we do not know the risk of lung cancer if you are a light smoker. Let’s say we have a population of 1,000,000 people: light smoking no smoking cancer 49,000 1,000 50,000 healthy 51,000 899,000 950,000 100,000 900,000 1,000,000 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(\\mbox{light} | \\mbox{lung cancer}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49,000}{50,000} = 0.98\\\\ P(\\mbox{lung cancer} | \\mbox{light}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49,000}{100,000} = 0.49\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What is the explanatory variable? What is the response variable? relative risk? odds ratio? Group A Group B expl = smoking status expl = lung cancer resp = lung cancer resp = smoking status If lung cancer is considered a success and no smoking is baseline: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} RR &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49/100}{1/900} = 441\\\\ OR &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49/51}{1/899} = 863.75\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If light smoking is considered a success and healthy is baseline: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} RR &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49/50}{51/950} = 18.25\\\\ OR &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49/1}{51/899} = 863.75\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] OR is the same no matter which variable you choose as explanatory versus response! Though, in general, we still prefer to know baseline odds or baseline risk (which we can’t know with a case-control study). Example 4.5 More on Smoking &amp; Lung Cancer, Chance and Rossman (2018) Now we have a cohort prospective study. (Previously we had a case-control retrospective study). Now do we have baseline risk estimates? Yes! But be careful, we can’t conclude causation, because the study is still observational. 4.4.4 Confidence Interval for OR Due to some theory that we won’t cover: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\ln (\\hat{OR})) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1 \\hat{p}_1 (1-\\hat{p}_1)} + \\frac{1}{n_2 \\hat{p}_2 (1-\\hat{p}_2)}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that your book introduces \\(SE(\\ln(\\hat{OR}))\\) in the context of hypothesis testing where the null, \\(H_0: \\pi_1 = \\pi_2\\), is assumed to be true. If the null is true, you’d prefer an estimate for the proportion of success to be based on the entire sample: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\ln (\\hat{OR})) &amp;\\approx&amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1 \\hat{p} (1-\\hat{p})} + \\frac{1}{n_2 \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] So, a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) CI for the \\(\\ln(OR)\\) is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\ln(\\hat{OR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} SE(\\ln(\\hat{OR})) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Which gives a \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) CI for the \\(OR\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (e^{\\ln(OR) - z_{1-\\alpha/2} SE(\\ln(OR))}, e^{\\ln(OR) + z_{1-\\alpha/2} SE(\\ln(OR))}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Back to the example… OR = 28.9. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} SE(\\ln(\\hat{OR})) &amp;=&amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{182*0.67*(1-0.67)} + \\frac{1}{122*0.0656*(1-0.0656)}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.398\\\\ 90\\% \\mbox{ CI for } \\ln(OR) &amp;&amp; \\ln(28.9) \\pm 1.645 \\cdot 0.398\\\\ &amp;&amp; 3.366 \\pm 1.645 \\cdot 0.398\\\\ &amp;&amp; (2.71, 4.02)\\\\ 90\\% \\mbox{ CI for } OR &amp;&amp; (e^{2.71}, e^{4.02})\\\\ &amp;&amp; (15.04, 55.47)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We are 90% confident that the true \\(\\ln(OR)\\) is between 2.71 and 4.02. We are 90% confident that the true \\(OR\\) is between 15.04 and 55.47. That is, the true odds of getting lung cancer if you smoke are somewhere between 15.04 and 55.47 times higher than if you don’t smoke, with 90% confidence. Note 1: we use the theory which allows us to understand the sampling distribution for the \\(\\ln(\\hat{OR}).\\) We use the process for creating CIs to transform back to \\(OR\\). Note 2: We do not use the t-distribution here because we are not estimating the population standard deviation. Note 3: There are not good general guidelines for checking whether the sample sizes are large enough for the normal approximation. Most authorities agree that one can get away with smaller sample sizes here than for the differences of two proportions. If the sample sizes pass the rough check discussed for \\(\\chi^2\\), they should be large enough to support inferences based on the approximate normality of the log of the estimated odds ratio, too. (Ramsey and Schafer 2012, 541) For the normal approximation to hold, we need the expected counts in each cell to be at least 5. (Pagano and Gauvreau 2000, 355) Note 4: If any of the cells are zero, many people will add 0.5 to that cell’s observed value. Note 5: The OR will always be more extreme than the RR (one more reason to be careful…) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{assume } &amp;&amp; \\frac{X_1 / n_1}{X_2 / n_2} = RR &gt; 1\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\frac{X_1}{n_1} &amp;=&amp; RR \\ \\ \\frac{X_2}{n_2}\\\\ \\frac{X_1}{n_1 - X_1} &amp;=&amp; RR \\ \\ \\bigg( \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\frac{n_2 - X_2}{n_1 - X_1} \\bigg) \\frac{X_2}{n_2-X_2}\\\\ OR &amp;=&amp; RR \\ \\ \\bigg(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\bigg) \\frac{n_2 - X_2}{n_1 - X_1}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; RR \\ \\ \\bigg(\\frac{1/n_2}{1/n_1} \\bigg) \\frac{n_2 - X_2}{n_1 - X_1}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; RR \\ \\ \\frac{1 - X_2/n_2}{1 - X_1/n_1}\\\\ &amp; &gt; &amp; RR \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [\\(1 - \\frac{X_2}{n_2} &gt; 1 - \\frac{X_1}{n_1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1 - \\frac{X_2}{n_2}}{1 - \\frac{X_1}{n_1}} &gt; 1\\)] Note 6: \\(RR \\approx OR\\) if RR is very small (the denominator of the OR will be very similar to the denominator of the RR). 4.5 Types of Studies (section 6.9) Definition 4.5 Explanatory variable is one that is a potential explanation for any changes in the response variable. Definition 4.6 Response variable is the measured outcome of interest. Definition 4.7 Case-control study: identify observational units by response Definition 4.8 Cohort study: identify observational units by explanatory variable Definition 4.9 Cross-classification study: identify observational units regardless of levels of the variable. 4.5.1 Retrospective versus Prospective Studies After much research (and asking many people who do not all agree!), I finally came across a definition of retrospective that I like. Note, however, that many many books define retrospective as synonymous with case-control. That is, they define a retrospective study to be one in which the observational units were chosen based on their status of the response variable. I disagree with that definition. As you see below, retrospective studies are defined based on the when the variables were measured. I’ve also given a quote from the Kuiper text where retrospective is defined as any study where historic data are collected (I like this definition less). Definition 4.10 A prospective study watches for outcomes, such as the development of a disease, during the study period. The explanatory variables are measured before the response variable occurs. Definition 4.11 A retrospective study looks backwards and examines exposures to suspected risk or protection factors in relation to an outcome that is established at the start of the study. The explanatory variables are measured after the response has happened. Studies can be classified further as either prospective or retrospective. We define a prospective study as one in which exposure and covariate measurements are made before the cases of illness occur. In a retrospective study these measurements are made after the cases have already occurred… Early writers referred to cohort studies as prospective studies and to case-control studies as retrospective studies because cohort studies usually begin with identification of the exposure status and then measure disease occurrence, whereas case-control studies usually begin by identifying cases and controls and then measure exposure status. The terms prospective and retrospective, however, are more usefully employed to describe the timing of disease occurrence with respect to exposure measurement. For example, case-control studies can be either prospective or retrospective. A prospective case-control study uses exposure measurements taken before disease, whereas a retrospective case-control study uses measurements taken after disease. (Rothman and Greenland 1998, 74) Retrospective cohort studies also exist. In these designs past (medical) records are often used to collect data. As with prospective cohort studies, the objective is still to first establish groups based on an explanatory variable. However since these are past records the response variable can be collected at the same time. (Kuiper and Sklar 2013, chap. 6, page 24) Understanding if a study is retrospective or prospective leads to having a sense of the biases within a study. The retrospective aspect may introduce selection bias and misclassification or information bias. With retrospective studies, the temporal relationship is frequently difficult to assess. Disadvantages of Prospective Cohort Studies You may have to follow large numbers of subjects for a long time. They can be very expensive and time consuming. They are not good for rare diseases. They are not good for diseases with a long latency. Differential loss to follow up can introduce bias. Disadvantages of Retrospective Cohort Studies As with prospective cohort studies, they are not good for very rare diseases. If one uses records that were not designed for the study, the available data may be of poor quality. There is frequently an absence of data on potential confounding factors if the data was recorded in the past. It may be difficult to identify an appropriate exposed cohort and an appropriate comparison group. Differential losses to follow up can also bias retrospective cohort studies. Disadvantages from: http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_CohortStudies/EP713_CohortStudies5.html Examples of studies: cross-classification, prospective: NHANES cross-classification, retrospective: death records (if exposure is measured post-hoc) case-control, prospective: the investigator still enrolls based on outcome status, but the investigator must wait to the cases to occur case-control, retrospective: at the start of the study, all cases have already occurred and the investigator goes back to measure the exposure (explanatory) variable cohort, retrospective: the exposure and outcomes have already happened (i.e., death records) cohort, prospective: follows the selected participants to assess the proportion who develop the disease of interest Which test? (section 6.1) It turns out that the tests above (independence, homogeneity of proportions, homogeneity of odds) are typically equivalent with respect to their conclusions. However, they each have particular assumptions about what they are testing, but that we can generally use any of them for our hypotheses of interest. However, we need to be very careful about our interpretations!

The difference between these two probabilities, 0.00499 was discounted as being too small to worry about. Is a different picture provided by considering odds? How is it interpreted? The logistic regression model is a generalized linear model. That is, a linear model as a function of the expected value of the response variable. We can now model binary response variables. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} GLM: g(E[Y | X]) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is the link function. For logistic regression, we use the logit link function: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit (p) = \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 5.1 Surviving third-degree burns These data refer to 435 adults who were treated for third-degree burns by the University of Southern California General Hospital Burn Center. The patients were grouped according to the area of third-degree burns on the body (measured in square cm). In the table below are recorded, for each midpoint of the groupings log(area +1), the number of patients in the corresponding group who survived, and the number who died from the burns. (Fan, Heckman, and Wand 1995) log(area+1) midpoint survived died prop surv 1.35 13 0 1 1.60 19 0 1 1.75 67 2 0.971 1.85 45 5 0.900 1.95 71 8 0.899 2.05 50 20 0.714 2.15 35 31 0.530 2.25 7 49 0.125 2.35 1 12 0.077 We can see that the logit transformation linearizes the relationship. A first idea might be to model the relationship between the probability of success (that the patient survives) and the explanatory variable log(area +1) as a simple linear regression model. However, the scatterplot of the proportions of patients surviving a third-degree burn against the explanatory variable shows a distinct curved relationship between the two variables, rather than a linear one. It seems that a transformation of the data is in place. The functional form relating x and the probability of success looks like it could be an S shape. But we’d have to do some work to figure out what the form of that S looks like. Below I’ve given some different relationships between x and the probability of success using \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) values that are yet to be defined. Regardless, we can see that by tuning the functional relationship of the S curve, we can get a good fit to the data. S-curves ( y = exp(linear) / (1+exp(linear)) ) for a variety of different parameter settings. Note that the x-axis is some continuous variable x while the y-axis is the probability of success at that value of x. More on this as we move through this model. Why doesn’t linear regression work here? The response isn’t normal The response isn’t linear (until we transform) The predicted values go outside the bounds of (0,1) Note: it does work to think about values inside (0,1) as probabilities 5.1.1 The logistic model Instead of trying to model the using linear regression, let’s say that we consider the relationship between the variable \\(x\\) and the probability of success to be given by the following generalized linear model. (The logistic model is just one model, there isn’t anything magical about it. We do have good reasons for how we defined it, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other good ways to model the relationship.) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(x) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}{1+e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Where \\(p(x)\\) is the probability of success (here surviving a burn). \\(\\beta_1\\) still determines the direction and slope of the line. \\(\\beta_0\\) now determines the location (median survival). Note 1 What is the probability of success for a patient with covariate of \\(x = -\\beta_0 / \\beta_1\\)? \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} x &amp;=&amp; - \\beta_0 / \\beta_1\\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x &amp;=&amp; 0\\\\ e^{0} &amp;=&amp; 1\\\\ p(-\\beta_0 / \\beta_1) &amp;=&amp; p(x) = 0.5 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] (for a given \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_0\\) determines the median survival value) Note 2 If \\(x=0\\), \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(0) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1+e^{\\beta_0}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(x=0\\) can often be thought of as the baseline condition, and the probability at \\(x=0\\) takes the place of thinking about the intercept in a linear regression. Note 3 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} 1 - p(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] gives the probability of failure. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] gives the odds of success. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} \\bigg) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\end{eqnarray*}\\] gives the \\(\\ln\\) odds of success . Note 4 Every type of generalized linear model has a link function. Ours is called the logit. The link is the relationship between the response variable and the linear function in x. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit(\\star) = \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{\\star}{1-\\star} \\bigg) \\ \\ \\ \\ 0 &lt; \\star &lt; 1 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 5.1.1.1 model assumptions Just like in linear regression, our Y response is the only random component. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} y &amp;=&amp; \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\mbox{ died}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{ survived} \\end{cases} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Y &amp;\\sim&amp; \\mbox{Bernoulli}(p)\\\\ P(Y=y) &amp;=&amp; p^y(1-p)^{1-y} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] When each person is at risk for a different covariate (i.e., explanatory variable), they each end up with a different probability of success. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} Y_i \\sim \\mbox{Bernoulli} \\bigg( p(x_i) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i}}{1+ e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i}}\\bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] independent trials success / failure probability of success is constant for a particular \\(X\\). \\(E[Y|x] = p(x)\\) is given by the logistic function 5.1.1.2 interpreting coefficients Let’s say the log odds of survival for given observed (log) burn areas \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\) are: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit(p(x)) &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\\\ \\logit(p(x+1)) &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\\\ \\beta_1 &amp;=&amp; \\logit(p(x+1)) - \\logit(p(x))\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{p(x+1)}{1-p(x+1)} - \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} \\bigg)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{p(x+1) / [1-p(x+1)]}{p(x) / [1-p(x)]} \\bigg)\\\\ e^{\\beta_1} &amp;=&amp; \\bigg( \\frac{p(x+1) / [1-p(x+1)]}{p(x) / [1-p(x)]} \\bigg)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) is the odds ratio for dying associated with a one unit increase in x. [\\(\\beta_1\\) is the change in log-odds associated with a one unit increase in x. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit (\\hat{p}) = 22.708 - 10.662 \\cdot \\ln(\\mbox{ area }+1). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] (Suppose we are interested in comparing the odds of surviving third-degree burns for patients with burns corresponding to log(area +1)= 1.90, and patients with burns corresponding to log(area +1)= 2.00. The odds ratio \\(\\hat{OR}_{1.90, 2.00}\\) is given by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{OR}_{1.90, 2.00} = e^{-10.662} (1.90-2.00) = e^{1.0662} = 2.904 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] That is, the odds of survival for a patient with log(area+1)= 1.90 is 2.9 times higher than the odds of survival for a patient with log(area+1)= 2.0.) What about the RR (relative risk) or difference in risks? It won’t be constant for a given \\(X\\), so it must be calculated as a function of \\(X\\). 5.1.2 constant OR, varying RR The previous model specifies that the OR is constant for any value of \\(X\\) which is not true about RR. Using the burn data, convince yourself that the RR isn’t constant. Try computing the RR at 1.5 versus 2.5, then again at 1 versus 2. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit (\\hat{p}) &amp;=&amp; 22.708 - 10.662 \\cdot \\ln(\\mbox{ area }+1)\\\\ \\hat{p(x)} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{22.708 - 10.662 x}}{1+e^{22.708 - 10.662 x}}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{p}(1) &amp;=&amp; 0.9999941\\\\ \\hat{p}(1.5) &amp;=&amp; 0.9987889\\\\ \\hat{p}(2) &amp;=&amp; 0.7996326\\\\ \\hat{p}(2.5) &amp;=&amp; 0.01894664\\\\ \\hat{RR}_{1, 2} &amp;=&amp; 1.250567\\\\ \\hat{RR}_{1.5, 2.5} &amp;=&amp; 52.71587\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{RR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}}{\\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 (x+1)}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 (x+1)}}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\frac{e^{b_0}e^{b_1 x}}{1+e^{b_0}e^{b_1 x}}}{\\frac{e^{b_0} e^{b_1 x} e^{b_1}}{1+e^{b_0}e^{b_1 x} e^{b_1}}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1+e^{b_0}e^{b_1 x}e^{b_1}}{e^{b_1}(1+e^{b_0}e^{b_1 x})}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] (see log-linear model below, 5.1.2.1 ) 5.1.2.1 Alternative strategies for binary outcomes It is quite common to have binary outcomes (response variable) in the medical literature. However, the logit link (logistic regression) is only one of a variety of models that we can use. We see above that the logistic model imposes a constant OR for any value of \\(X\\) (and not a constant RR). complementary log-log The complementary log-log model is used when you have a rate of, for example, infection, model by instances of contact (based on a Poisson model). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(k) &amp;=&amp; 1-(1-\\lambda)^k\\\\ \\ln[ - \\ln (1-p(k))] &amp;=&amp; \\ln[-\\ln(1-\\lambda)] + \\ln(k)\\\\ \\ln[ - \\ln (1-p(k))] &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + 1 \\cdot \\ln(k)\\\\ \\ln[ - \\ln (1-p(k))] &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\\\ p(x) &amp;=&amp; 1 - \\exp [ -\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x) ] \\end{eqnarray*}\\] linear The excess (or additive) risk model can modeled by using simple linear regression: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(x) &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\end{eqnarray*}\\] which we have already seen is problematic for a variety of reasons. However, any unit increase in \\(x\\) gives a \\(\\beta_1\\) increase in the risk (for all values of \\(x\\)). log-linear As long as we do not have a case-control study, we can model the risk using a log-linear model. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\ln (p(x)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The regression coefficient, \\(\\beta_1\\), has the interpretation of the logarithm of the relative risk associated with a unit increase in \\(x\\). Although many software programs will fit this model, it may present numerical difficulties because of the constraint that the sum of terms on the right-hand side must be no greater than zero for the results to make sense (due to the constraint that the outcome probability p(x) must be in the interval [0,1]). As a result, convergence of standard fitting algorithms may be unreliable in some cases. 5.2 Estimating coefficients in logistic regression 5.2.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Recall how we estimated the coefficients for linear regression. We minimized the residual sum of squares: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} RSS &amp;=&amp; \\sum_i (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_i (Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i))^2 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] That is, we take derivatives with respect to both \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), set them equal to zero (take second derivatives to ensure minimums), and solve for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). It turns out that we’ve also maximized the normal likelihood. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\underline{y} | b_0, b_1, \\underline{x}) &amp;=&amp; \\prod_i \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{(y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2 / 2 \\sigma}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\bigg( \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} \\bigg)^{n/2} e^{\\sum_i (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2 / 2 \\sigma}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What does that even mean? Likelihood? Maximizing the likelihood? WHY??? The likelihood is the probability distribution of the data given specific values of the unknown parameters. Consider a toy example describing, for example, flipping coins. Let’s say \\(X \\sim Bin(p, n=4).\\) We have 4 trials and \\(X=1\\). Would you guess \\(p=0.49\\)?? No, you would guess \\(p=0.25\\)… you maximized the likelihood of seeing your data. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(X=1 | p) &amp;=&amp; {4 \\choose 1} p^1 (1-p)^{4-1}\\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.9) &amp;=&amp; 0.0036 \\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.75) &amp;=&amp; 0.047 \\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.5) &amp;=&amp; 0.25\\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.05) &amp;=&amp; 0.171\\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.15) &amp;=&amp; 0.368\\\\ P(X=1 | p = 0.25) &amp;=&amp; 0.422\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Or, we can think about it as a set of independent binary responses, \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots Y_n\\). Since each observed response is independent and follows the Bernoulli distribution, the probability of a particular outcome can be found as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(Y_1=y_1, Y_2=y_2, \\ldots, Y_n=y_n) &amp;=&amp; P(Y_1=y_1) P(Y_2 = y_2) \\cdots P(Y_n = y_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; p^{y_1}(1-p)^{1-y_1} p^{y_2}(1-p)^{1-y_2} \\cdots p^{y_n}(1-p)^{1-y_n}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; p^{\\sum_i y_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_i (1-y_i)}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\) represents a particular observed series of 0 or 1 outcomes and \\(p\\) is a probability \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\). Once \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\) have been observed, they are fixed values. Maximum likelihood estimates are functions of sample data that are derived by finding the value of \\(p\\) that maximizes the likelihood functions. To maximize the likelihood, we use the natural log of the likelihood (because we know we’ll get the same answer): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\ln L(p) &amp;=&amp; \\ln \\Bigg(p^{\\sum_i y_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_i (1-y_i)} \\Bigg)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_i y_i \\ln(p) + (n- \\sum_i y_i) \\ln (1-p)\\\\ \\frac{ \\partial \\ln L(p)}{\\partial p} &amp;=&amp; \\sum_i y_i \\frac{1}{p} + (n - \\sum_i y_i) \\frac{-1}{(1-p)} = 0\\\\ 0 &amp;=&amp; (1-p) \\sum_i y_i + p (n-\\sum_i y_i) \\\\ \\hat{p} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{ \\sum_i y_i}{n} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Using the logistic regression model makes the likelihood substantially more complicated because the probability of success changes for each individual. Recall: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p_i = p(x_i) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] which gives a likelihood of: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\underline{p}) &amp;=&amp; \\prod_i \\Bigg( \\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}} \\Bigg)^{y_i} \\Bigg(1-\\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}} \\Bigg)^{(1- y_i)} \\\\ \\mbox{&amp; a loglikelihood of}: &amp;&amp;\\\\ \\ln L(\\underline{p}) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_i y_i \\ln\\Bigg( \\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}} \\Bigg) + (1- y_i) \\ln \\Bigg(1-\\frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}}{1+e^{b_0 + b_1 x_i}} \\Bigg)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Why use maximum likelihood estimates? Estimates are essentially unbiased. We can estimate the SE (Wald estimates via Fisher Information). The estimates have low variability. The estimates have an approximately normal sampling distribution for large sample sizes because they are maximum likelihood estimates. Though it is important to realize that we cannot find estimates in closed form. 5.3 Formal Inference 5.3.1 Wald Tests &amp; Intervals Because we will use maximum likelihood parameter estimates, we can also use large sample theory to find the SEs and consider the estimates to have normal distributions (for large sample sizes). However, (Menard 1995) warns that for large coefficients, standard error is inflated, lowering the Wald statistic (chi-square) value. (Agresti 1996) states that the likelihood-ratio test is more reliable for small sample sizes than the Wald test. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} z = \\frac{b_1 - \\beta_1}{SE(b_1)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] library(tidyverse); library(broom) glm(burnresp~burnexpl, data = burnglm, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) ## ## Call: glm(formula = burnresp ~ burnexpl, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = burnglm) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) burnexpl ## 22.71 -10.66 ## ## Degrees of Freedom: 434 Total (i.e. Null); 433 Residual ## Null Deviance: 525.4 ## Residual Deviance: 335.2 AIC: 339.2 glm(burnresp~burnexpl, data = burnglm, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 22.7 2.27 10.0 1.23e-23 ## 2 burnexpl -10.7 1.08 -9.85 6.95e-23 5.3.2 Likelihood Ratio Tests \\(\\frac{L(p_0)}{L(\\hat{p})}\\) gives us a sense of whether the null value or the observed value produces a higher likelihood. Recall: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\hat{\\underline{p}}) &gt; L(p_0) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] always. [Where \\(\\hat{\\underline{p}}\\) is the maximum likelihood estimate for the probability of success (here it will be a vector of probabilities, each based on the same MLE estimates of the linear parameters). ] The above inequality holds because \\(\\hat{\\underline{p}}\\) maximizes the likelihood. We can show that if \\(H_0\\) is true, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} -2 \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{L(p_0)}{L(\\hat{p})} \\bigg) \\sim \\chi^2_1 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If we are testing only one parameter value. More generally, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} -2 \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{\\max L_0}{\\max L} \\bigg) \\sim \\chi^2_\\nu \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\nu\\) is the number of extra parameters we estimate using the unconstrained likelihood (as compared to the constrained null likelihood). Example 4.2 Consider a data set with 147 people. 49 got cancer and 98 didn’t. Let’s test whether the true proportion of people who get cancer is \\(p=0.25\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0:&amp;&amp; p=0.25\\\\ H_1:&amp;&amp; p \\ne 0.25\\\\ \\hat{p} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{49}{147}\\\\ -2 \\ln \\bigg( \\frac{L(p_0)}{L(\\hat{p})} \\bigg) &amp;=&amp; -2 [ \\ln (L(p_0)) - \\ln(L(\\hat{p}))]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -2 \\Bigg[ \\ln \\bigg( (0.25)^{y} (0.75)^{n-y} \\bigg) - \\ln \\Bigg( \\bigg( \\frac{y}{n} \\bigg)^{y} \\bigg( \\frac{(n-y)}{n} \\bigg)^{n-y} \\Bigg) \\Bigg]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -2 \\Bigg[ \\ln \\bigg( (0.25)^{49} (0.75)^{98} \\bigg) - \\ln \\Bigg( \\bigg( \\frac{1}{3} \\bigg)^{49} \\bigg( \\frac{2}{3} \\bigg)^{98} \\Bigg) \\Bigg]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -2 [ \\ln(0.0054) - \\ln(0.0697) ] = 5.11\\\\ P( \\chi^2_1 \\geq 5.11) &amp;=&amp; 0.0238 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] But really, usually likelihood ratio tests are more interesting. In fact, usually, we use them to test whether the coefficients are zero: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: &amp;&amp; \\beta_1 =0\\\\ H_1: &amp;&amp; \\beta_1 \\ne 0\\\\ p_0 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) is fit from a model without any explanatory variable, \\(x\\).

In the survey, 2484 people were classified according to their proneness to snoring (never, occasionally, often, always) and whether or not they had the heart disease. Variable Description disease (response variable) Binary variable: having disease=1, not having disease=0 snoring (explanatory variable) Categorical variable indicating level of snoring (never=1, occasionally=2, often=3 and always=4) Source: (Norton and Dunn 1985) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} X_1 = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for occasionally} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{cases} X_2 = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for often} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{cases} X_3 = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for always} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Our new model becomes: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit(p) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_3 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We can use the drop-in-deviance test to test the effect of any or all of the parameters (of which there are now four) in the model. See the birdnest example, 5.8 5.4 Multiple Logistic Regression 5.4.1 Interaction Another worry when building models with multiple explanatory variables has to do with variables interacting. That is, for one level of a variable, the relationship of the main predictor on the response is different. Example 4.3 Consider a simple linear regression model on number of hours studied and exam grade. Then addclass year to the model. There would probably be a different slope for each class year in order to model the two variables most effectively. For simplicity, consider only first year students and seniors. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} E[\\mbox{grade seniors}| \\mbox{hours studied}] &amp;=&amp; \\beta_{0s} + \\beta_{1s} \\mbox{hrs}\\\\ E[\\mbox{grade first years}| \\mbox{hours studied}] &amp;=&amp; \\beta_{0f} + \\beta_{1f} \\mbox{hrs}\\\\ E[\\mbox{grade}| \\mbox{hours studied}] &amp;=&amp; \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\mbox{hrs} + \\beta_2 I(\\mbox{year=senior}) + \\beta_{3} \\mbox{hrs} I(\\mbox{year = senior})\\\\ \\beta_{0f} &amp;=&amp; \\beta_{0}\\\\ \\beta_{0s} &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\\\ \\beta_{1f} &amp;=&amp; \\beta_1\\\\ \\beta_{1s} &amp;=&amp; \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Why do we need the \\(I(\\mbox{year=seniors})\\) variable? Definition 4.3 Interaction means that the effect of an explanatory variable on the outcome differs according to the level of another explanatory variable. (Not the case with age on smoking and lung cancer above. With the smoking example, age is a significant variable, but it does not interact with lung cancer.) Example 5.2 The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of estrogen plus progestin therapy for prevention of recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD) events in women. The participants are postmenopausal women with a uterus and with CHD. Each woman was randomly assigned to receive one tablet containing 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily or an identical placebo. The results of the first large randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on women with heart disease appeared in JAMA in 1998 (Hulley et al. 1998). The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) found that the use of estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with heart disease did not prevent further heart attacks or death from coronary heart disease (CHD). This occurred despite the positive effect of treatment on lipoproteins: LDL (bad) cholesterol was reduced by 11 percent and HDL (good) cholesterol was increased by 10 percent. The hormone replacement regimen also increased the risk of clots in the veins (deep vein thrombosis) and lungs (pulmonary embolism). The results of HERS are surprising in light of previous observational studies, which found lower rates of CHD in women who take postmenopausal estrogen. Data available at: http://www.biostat.ucsf.edu/vgsm/data/excel/hersdata.xls For now, we will try to predict whether the individuals had a pre-existing medical condition (other than CHD, self reported), medcond. We will use the variables age, weight, diabetes and drinkany.

Does the interpretation change with interaction? In the last model, we might want to remove all the age information. Age seems to be less important than drinking status. How do we decide? How do we model? 5.4.2 Simpson’s Paradox Simpson’s paradox is when the association between two variables is opposite the partial association between the same two variables after controlling for one or more other variables. Example 4.5 Back to linear regression to consider Simpson’s Paradox. Consider data on SAT scores across different states with information on educational expenditure. The correlation between SAT score and average teacher salary is negative with the combined data. However, SAT score and average teacher salary is positive after controlling for the fraction of students who take the exam. The fewer students who take the exam, the higher the SAT score. That’s because states whose public universities encourage the ACT have SAT-takers who are leaving the state for college (with their higher SAT scores). ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 1159. 57.7 20.1 5.13e-25 ## 2 salary -5.54 1.63 -3.39 1.39e- 3 ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 988. 31.9 31.0 6.20e-33 ## 2 salary 2.18 1.03 2.12 3.94e- 2 ## 3 frac -2.78 0.228 -12.2 4.00e-16 Example 5.3 Consider the example on smoking and 20-year mortality (case) from section 3.4 of Regression Methods in Biostatistics, pg 52-53. age test smoker nonsmoker prob smoke odds smoke empirical OR all case 139 230 0.377 0.604 0.685 control 443 502 0.469 0.882 18-44 case 61 32 0.656 1.906 1.627 control 375 320 0.540 1.172 45-64 case 34 66 0.340 0.515 1.308 control 50 127 0.282 0.394 65+ case 44 132 0.250 0.333 1.019 control 18 55 0.247 0.327 What we see is that the vast majority of the controls were young, and they had a high rate of smoking. A good chunk of the cases were older, and the rate of smoking was substantially lower in the oldest group. However, within each group, the cases were more likely to smoke than the controls. After adjusting for age, smoking is no longer significant. But more importantly, age is a variable that reverses the effect of smoking on cancer - Simpson’s Paradox. The effect is not due to the observational nature of the study, and so it is important to adjust for possible influential variables regardless of the study at hand. What would it mean to adjust for age in this context? It means that we have to include it in the model: death &lt;- c(rep(1,93),rep(0,695), rep(1,100),rep(0,177), rep(1,176), rep(0,73)) smoke &lt;- c(rep(1,61), rep(0,32), rep(1,375), rep(0,320), rep(1,34), rep(0,66), rep(1,50), rep(0,127), rep(1,44), rep(0,132), rep(1,18), rep(0,55)) age &lt;- c(rep(&quot;young&quot;, 788), rep(&quot;middle&quot;, 277), rep(&quot;old&quot;, 249) ) glm( death ~ smoke, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -0.781 0.0796 -9.80 1.10e-22 ## 2 smoke -0.379 0.126 -3.01 2.59e- 3 glm( death ~ as.factor(age), family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -0.571 0.125 -4.56 5.01e- 6 ## 2 as.factor(age)old 1.45 0.187 7.75 9.00e-15 ## 3 as.factor(age)young -1.44 0.167 -8.63 6.02e-18 glm( death ~ smoke + as.factor(age), family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -0.668 0.135 -4.96 7.03e- 7 ## 2 smoke 0.312 0.154 2.03 4.25e- 2 ## 3 as.factor(age)old 1.47 0.188 7.84 4.59e-15 ## 4 as.factor(age)young -1.52 0.173 -8.81 1.26e-18 glm( death ~ smoke * as.factor(age), family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -0.655 0.152 -4.31 1.61e- 5 ## 2 smoke 0.269 0.269 0.999 3.18e- 1 ## 3 as.factor(age)old 1.53 0.221 6.93 4.29e-12 ## 4 as.factor(age)young -1.65 0.240 -6.88 6.00e-12 ## 5 smoke:as.factor(age)old -0.251 0.420 -0.596 5.51e- 1 ## 6 smoke:as.factor(age)young 0.218 0.355 0.614 5.40e- 1 Using the additive model above: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\logit (p(x_1, x_2) ) &amp;=&amp; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\\\ OR &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{odds dying if } (x_1, x_2) / \\mbox{odds dying if } (x_1^*, x_2^*) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1^* + \\beta_2 x_2^*}}\\\\ x_1 &amp;=&amp; \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\mbox{ don&#39;t smoke}\\\\ 1 &amp; \\mbox{ smoke}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\\\ x_2 &amp;=&amp; \\begin{cases} \\mbox{young} &amp; \\mbox{18-44 years old}\\\\ \\mbox{middle} &amp; \\mbox{45-64 years old}\\\\ \\mbox{old} &amp; \\mbox{65+ years old}\\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where we are modeling the probability of 20-year mortality using smoking status and age group. Note 1: We can see from above that the coefficients for each variable are significantly different from zero. That is, the variables are important in predicting odds of survival. Note 2: We can see that smoking becomes less significant as we add age into the model. That is because age and smoking status are so highly associated (think of the coin example). Note 3: We can estimate any of the OR (of dying for smoke vs not smoke) from the given coefficients: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{simple model} &amp;&amp;\\\\ \\mbox{overall OR} &amp;=&amp; e^{-0.37858 } = 0.6848332\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\\\ \\mbox{additive model} &amp;&amp;\\\\ \\mbox{young, middle, old OR} &amp;=&amp; e^{ 0.3122} = 1.3664\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\\\ \\mbox{interaction model} &amp;&amp;\\\\ \\mbox{young OR} &amp;=&amp; e^{0.2689 + 0.2177} = 1.626776\\\\ \\mbox{middle OR} &amp;=&amp; e^{0.2689} = 1.308524\\\\ \\mbox{old OR} &amp;=&amp; e^{0.2689 + -0.2505} = 1.018570\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What does it mean that the interaction terms are not significant in the last model? 5.5 Multicolinearity Consider the following data set collected from church offering plates in 62 consecutive Sundays. Also noted is whether there was enough change to buy a candy bar for $1.25. glm(CandyYes ~ Coins, data = Offering, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -4.14 0.996 -4.16 0.0000321 ## 2 Coins 0.286 0.0772 3.70 0.000213 glm(CandyYes ~ Small, data = Offering, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -2.33 0.585 -3.98 0.0000693 ## 2 Small 0.184 0.0576 3.19 0.00142 glm(CandyYes ~ Coins + Small, data = Offering, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -17.0 7.80 -2.18 0.0296 ## 2 Coins 3.49 1.75 1.99 0.0461 ## 3 Small -3.04 1.57 -1.93 0.0531 Notice that the directionality of the low coins changes when it is included in the model that already contains the number of coins total. Lesson of the story: be very very very careful interpreting coefficients when you have multiple explanatory variables. 5.6 Model Building Example 5.4 Suppose that you have to take an exam that covers 100 different topics, and you do not know any of them. The rules, however, state that you can bring two classmates as consultants. Suppose also that you know which topics each of your classmates is familiar with. If you could bring only one consultant, it is easy to figure out who you would bring: it would be the one who knows the most topics (the variable most associated with the answer). Let’s say this is Sage who knows 85 topics. With two consultants you might choose Sage first, and for the second option, it seems reasonable to choose the second most knowledgeable classmate (the second most highly associated variable), for example Bruno, who knows 75 topics. The problem with this strategy is that it may be that the 75 subjects Bruno knows are already included in the 85 that Sage knows, and therefore, Bruno does not provide any knowledge beyond that of Sage. A better strategy is to select the second not by considering what he or she knows regarding the entire agenda, but by looking for the person who knows more about the topics than the first does not know (the variable that best explains the residual of the equation with the variables entered). It may even happen that the best pair of consultants are not the most knowledgeable, as there may be two that complement each other perfectly in such a way that one knows 55 topics and the other knows the remaining 45, while the most knowledgeable does not complement anybody. 5.6.1 Formal Model Building We are going to discuss how to add (or subtract) variables from a model. Before we do that, we can define two criteria used for suggesting an optimal model. AIC: Akaike’s Information Criteria = \\(-2 \\ln\\) likelihood + \\(2p\\) BIC: Bayesian Information Criteria = \\(-2 \\ln\\) likelihood \\(+p \\ln(n)\\) Both techniques suggest choosing a model with the smallest AIC and BIC value; both adjust for the number of parameters in the model and are more likely to select models with fewer variables than the drop-in-deviance test. 5.6.1.1 Stepwise Regression As done previously, we can add and remove variables based on the deviance. Recall, when comparing two nested models, the differences in the deviances can be modeled by a \\(\\chi^2_\\nu\\) variable where \\(\\nu = \\Delta p\\). Consider the HERS data described in your book (page 30); variable description also given on the book website http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/biostat/vgsm/data/hersdata.codebook.txt For now, we will try to predict whether the individuals had a medical condition, medcond (defined as a pre-existing and self-reported medical condition). We will use the variables age, weight, diabetes and drinkany.

We should also look at interactions which we might suspect. However, looking at all possible interactions (if only 2-way interactions, we could also consider 3-way interactions etc.), things can get out of hand quickly. We start with the response variable versus all variables and find the best predictor. If there are too many, we might just look at the correlation matrix. However, we may miss out of variables that are good predictors but aren’t linearly related. Therefore, if its possible, a scatter plot matrix would be best. We locate the best variable, and regress the response variable on it. If the variable seems to be useful, we keep it and move on to looking for a second. If not, we stop. 5.6.1.1.2 Forward Stepwise Selection This method follows in the same way as Forward Regression, but as each new variable enters the model, we check to see if any of the variables already in the model can now be removed. This is done by specifying two values, \\(\\alpha_e\\) as the \\(\\alpha\\) level needed to enter the model, and \\(\\alpha_l\\) as the \\(\\alpha\\) level needed to leave the model. We require that \\(\\alpha_e&lt;\\alpha_l\\), otherwise, our algorithm could cycle, we add a variable, then immediately decide to delete it, continuing ad infinitum. This is bad. We start with the empty model, and add the best predictor, assuming the p-value associated with it is smaller than \\(\\alpha_e\\). Now, we find the best of the remaining variables, and add it if the p-value is smaller than \\(\\alpha_e\\). If we add it, we also check to see if the first variable can be dropped, by calculating the p-value associated with it (which is different from the first time, because now there are two variables in the model). If its p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha_l\\), we remove the variable. We continue with this process until there are no more variables that meet either requirements. In many situations, this will help us from stopping at a less than desirable model. How do you choose the \\(\\alpha\\) values? If you set \\(\\alpha_e\\) to be very small, you might walk away with no variables in your model, or at least not many. If you set it to be large, you will wander around for a while, which is a good thing, because you will explore more models, but you may end up with variables in your model that aren’t necessary. 5.6.1.1.3 Backward Selection Start with the full model including every term (and possibly every interaction, etc.). Remove the variable that is least significant (biggest p-value) in the model.

The logistic regression model is underspecified. The logistic regression model contains extraneous variables. The logistic regression model is overspecified. Underspecified A regression model is underspecified if it is missing one or more important predictor variables. Being underspecified is the worst case scenario because the model ends up being biased and predictions are wrong for virtually every observation. (Think about Simpson’s Paradox and the need for interaction.) Extraneous The third type of variable situation comes when extra variables are included in the model but the variables are neither related to the response nor are they correlated with the other explanatory variables. Generally, extraneous variables are not so problematic because they produce models with unbiased coefficient estimators, unbiased predictions, and unbiased variance estimates. The worst thing that happens is that the error degrees of freedom is lowered which makes confidence intervals wider and p-values bigger (lower power). Also problematic is that the model becomes unnecessarily complicated and harder to interpret. Overspecified When a model is overspecified, there are one or more redundant variables. That is, the variables contain the same information as other variables (i.e., are correlated!). As we’ve seen, correlated variables cause trouble because they inflate the variance of the coefficient estimates. With correlated variables it is still possible to get unbiased prediction estimates, but the coefficients themselves are so variable that they cannot be interpreted (nor can inference be easily performed). Generally: the idea is to use a model building strategy with some criteria (\\(\\chi^2\\)-tests, AIC, BIC, ROC, AUC) to find the middle ground between an underspecified model and an overspecified model. 5.6.2.1 One Model Building Strategy Taken from https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/332. Model building is definitely an ``art.&quot; Unsurprisingly, there are many approaches to model building, but here is one strategy, consisting of seven steps, that is commonly used when building a regression model. The first step Decide on the type of model that is needed in order to achieve the goals of the study. In general, there are five reasons one might want to build a regression model. They are: For predictive reasons - that is, the model will be used to predict the response variable from a chosen set of predictors. For theoretical reasons - that is, the researcher wants to estimate a model based on a known theoretical relationship between the response and predictors. For control purposes - that is, the model will be used to control a response variable by manipulating the values of the predictor variables. For inferential reasons - that is, the model will be used to explore the strength of the relationships between the response and the predictors. For data summary reasons - that is, the model will be used merely as a way to summarize a large set of data by a single equation. The second step Decide which explanatory variables and response variable on which to collect the data. Collect the data. The third step Explore the data. That is: On a univariate basis, check for outliers, gross data errors, and missing values. Study bivariate relationships to reveal other outliers, to suggest possible transformations, and to identify possible multicollinearities. I can’t possibly over-emphasize the data exploration step. There’s not a data analyst out there who hasn’t made the mistake of skipping this step and later regretting it when a data point was found in error, thereby nullifying hours of work. The fourth step (The fourth step is very good modeling practice. It gives you a sense of whether or not you’ve overfit the model in the building process.) Randomly divide the data into a training set and a validation set: The training set, with at least 15-20 error degrees of freedom, is used to estimate the model. The validation set is used for cross-validation of the fitted model. The fifth step Using the training set, identify several candidate models: Use best subsets regression. Use stepwise regression, which of course only yields one model unless different alpha-to-remove and alpha-to-enter values are specified. The sixth step Select and evaluate a few “good” models: Select the models based on the criteria we learned, as well as the number and nature of the predictors. Evaluate the selected models for violation of the model conditions. If none of the models provide a satisfactory fit, try something else, such as collecting more data, identifying different predictors, or formulating a different type of model. The seventh and final step Select the final model: A large cross-validation AUC on the validation data is indicative of a good predictive model (for your population of interest). Consider false positive rate, false negative rate, outliers, parsimony, relevance, and ease of measurement of predictors. And, most of all, don’t forget that there is not necessarily only one good model for a given set of data. There might be a few equally satisfactory models. 5.6.2.2 Another Model Building Strategy Another strategy for model building. Figure taken from (Ramsey and Schafer 2012) 5.7 Model Assessment 5.7.1 Measures of Association With logistic regression, we don’t have residuals, so we don’t have a value like \\(R^2\\). We can, however, measure whether or not the estimated model is consistent with the data. That is, is the model able to discriminate between successes and failures. 5.7.1.1 back to the burn data 5.1: Consider looking at all the pairs of successes and failures. In the burn data we have 308 survivors and 127 deaths = 39,116 pairs of people. Given a particular pair, if the observation corresponding to a survivor has a higher probability of success than the observation corresponding to a death, we call the pair concordant. If the observation corresponding to a survivor has a lower probability of success than the observation corresponding to a death, we call the pair discordant. Tied pairs occur when the observed survivor has the same estimated probability as the observed death. \\(D_{xy}\\): Somers’ D is the number of concordant pairs minus the number of discordant pairs divided by the total number of pairs. gamma: Goodman-Kruskal gamma is the number of concordant pairs minus the number of discordant pairs divided by the total number of pairs excluding ties. tau-a: Kendall’s tau-a is the number of concordant pairs minus the number of discordant pairs divided by the total number of pairs of people (including pairs who both survived or both died). For example: consider a pair of individuals with burn areas of 1.75 and 2.35. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(x=1.75) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{22.7083-10.6624\\cdot 1.75}}{1+e^{22.7083 -10.6624\\cdot 1.75}} = 0.983\\\\ p(x=2.35) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{22.7083-10.6624\\cdot 2.35}}{1+e^{22.7083 -10.6624\\cdot 2.35}} = 0.087 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The pairs would be concordant if the first individual survived and the second didn’t. The pairs would be discordant if the first individual died and the second survived. # install.packages(c(&quot;Hmisc&quot;, &quot;rms&quot;)) library(rms) # you need this line!! burn.glm &lt;- lrm(burnresp~burnexpl, data = burnglm) print(burn.glm) ## Logistic Regression Model ## ## lrm(formula = burnresp ~ burnexpl, data = burnglm) ## ## Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. ## Ratio Test Indexes Indexes ## Obs 435 LR chi2 190.15 R2 0.505 C 0.877 ## 0 127 d.f. 1 g 2.576 Dxy 0.753 ## 1 308 Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001 gr 13.146 gamma 0.824 ## max |deriv| 8e-11 gp 0.313 tau-a 0.312 ## Brier 0.121 ## ## Coef S.E.

A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between Truth positive negative Predicted positive true positive false positive \\(P&#39;\\) negative false negative true negative \\(N&#39;\\) \\(P\\) \\(N\\) type I error = FP type II error = FN sensitivity = power = true positive rate (TPR) = TP / P = TP / (TP+FN) false positive rate (FPR) = FP / N = FP / (FP + TN) specificity = 1 - FPR = TN / (FP + TN) accuracy (acc) = (TP+TN) / (P+N) positive predictive value (PPV) = precision = TP / (TP + FP) negative predictive value (NPV) = TN / (TN + FN) false discovery rate = 1 - PPV = FP / (FP + TP) Example 5.5 For example: consider a pair of individuals with burn areas of 1.75 and 2.35. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p(x=1.75) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{22.7083-10.6624\\cdot 1.75}}{1+e^{22.7083 -10.6624\\cdot 1.75}} = 0.983\\\\ p(x=2.35) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{22.7083-10.6624\\cdot 2.35}}{1+e^{22.7083 -10.6624\\cdot 2.35}} = 0.087\\\\ x &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{log area burned} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What value would we assign to 1.75 or 2.35 or 15 for log(area) burned? By changing our cutoff, we can fit an entire curve. We want the curve to be as far in the upper left corner as possible (sensitivity = 1, specificity = 1). Notice that the color band represents the probability cutoff for predicting a ``success.“ A: Let’s say we use prob=0.25 as a cutoff: truth yes no predicted yes 300 66 no 8 61 308 127 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{sensitivity} &amp;=&amp; TPR = 300/308 = 0.974\\\\ \\mbox{specificity} &amp;=&amp; 61 / 127 = 0.480, \\mbox{1 - specificity} = FPR = 0.520\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] B: Let’s say we use prob=0.7 as a cutoff: truth yes no predicted yes 265 35 no 43 92 308 127 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{sensitivity} &amp;=&amp; TPR = 265/308 = 0.860\\\\ \\mbox{specificity} &amp;=&amp; 92/127 = 0.724, \\mbox{1 - specificity} = FPR = 0.276\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] C: Let’s say we use prob=0.9 as a cutoff: truth yes no predicted yes 144 7 no 164 120 308 127 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{sensitivity} &amp;=&amp; TPR = 144/308 = 0.467\\\\ \\mbox{specificity} &amp;=&amp; 120/127 = 0.945, \\mbox{1 - specificity} = FPR = 0.055\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] D: all models will go through (0,0) \\(\\rightarrow\\) predict everything negative, prob=1 as your cutoff E: all models will go through (1,1) \\(\\rightarrow\\) predict everything positive, prob=0 as your cutoff F: you have a model that gives perfect sensitivity (no FN!) and specificity (no FP) G: random guessing. If classifier randomly guess, it should get half the positives correct and half the negatives correct. If it guesses 90% of the positives correctly, it will also guess 90% of the negatives to be positive. H: is worse than random guessing. Note that the opposite classifier to (H) might be quite good! 5.7.3 Cross Validation Before reading the notes here, look through the following visualization. Don’t worry about building the model (classification trees are not a topic for class), but check out the end where they talk about predicting on test and training data. http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/ 5.7.3.1 Overfitting Imagine you are preparing for your statistics exam. Helpfully, Professor Hardin has made previous exam papers and their worked answers available online. You begin by trying to answer the questions from previous papers and comparing your answers with the model answers provided. Unfortunately, you get carried away and spend all your time on memorizing the model answers to all past questions. Now, if the upcoming exam completely consists of past questions, you are certain to do very well. But if the new exam asks different questions about the same material, you would be ill-prepared and get a much lower mark than with a more traditional preparation. In this case, one could say that you were overfitting the past exam papers and that the knowledge gained didn’t generalize to future exam questions. 5.7.3.2 CV Model Assessment Cross validation is commonly used to perform two different tasks: 1. To assess a model’s accuracy (model assessment). 2. To build a model (model selection). We will focus here only on model assessment. Suppose that we build a classifier (logistic regression model) on a given data set. We’d like to know how well the model classifies observations, but if we test on the samples at hand, the error rate will be much lower than the model’s inherent accuracy rate. Instead, we’d like to predict new observations that were not used to create the model. There are various ways of creating test or validation sets of data: one training set, one test set [two drawbacks: estimate of error is highly variable because it depends on which points go into the training set; and because the training data set is smaller than the full data set, the error rate is biased in such a way that it overestimates the actual error rate of the modeling technique.] leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) [LOOCV is a special case of \\(k\\)-fold CV with \\(k=n\\)] remove one observation build the model using the remaining n-1 points predict class membership for the observation which was removed repeat by removing each observation one at a time (time consuming to keep building models) \\(k\\)-fold cross validation (\\(k\\)-fold CV) like LOOCV except that the algorithm is run \\(k\\) times on each group (of approximately equal size) from a partition of the data set. advantage of \\(k\\)-fold is computational \\(k\\)-fold often has a better bias-variance trade-off [bias is lower with LOOCV. however, because LOOCV predicts \\(n\\) observations from \\(n\\) models which are all basically the same, the variability will be higher. with \\(k\\)-fold, prediction is on \\(n\\) values from \\(k\\) models which are much less correlated. the effect is to average out the predicted values in such a way that there will be less variability from data set to data set. 5.8 R: Birdnest Example Length of Bird Nest This example is from problem E1 in your text and includes 99 species of N. American passerine birds. Recall that the response variable is binary and represents whether there is a small opening (closed=1) or a large opening (closed=0) for the nest. The explanatory variable of interest was the length of the bird. nests &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/Dropbox/teaching/math150/PracStatCD/Data Sets/Chapter 07/CSV Files/C7 Birdnest.csv&quot;, na=&quot;*&quot;) 5.8.1 Drop-in-deviance (Likelihood Ratio Test, LRT) \\(\\chi^2\\): The Likelihood ratio test also tests whether the response is explained by the explanatory variable. We can output the deviance ( = K - 2 * log-likelihood) for both the full (maximum likelihood!) and reduced (null) models. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} G &amp;=&amp; 2 \\cdot \\ln(L(MLE)) - 2 \\cdot \\ln(L(null))\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{null (restricted) deviance - residual (full model) deviance}\\\\ G &amp;\\sim&amp; \\chi^2_{\\nu} \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{when the null hypothesis is true} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\nu\\) represents the difference in the number of parameters needed to estimate in the full model versus the null model. glm(`Closed?` ~ Length, data = nests, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.457 0.753 0.607 0.544 ## 2 Length -0.0677 0.0425 -1.59 0.112 glm(`Closed?` ~ Length, data = nests, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% glance() %&gt;% print.data.frame(digits=6) ## null.deviance df.null logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual ## 1 119.992 94 -58.4399 120.88 125.987 116.88 93 5.8.2 Difference between tidy and augment and glance Note that tidy contains the same number of rows as the number of coefficients. augment contains the same number of rows as number of observations. glance always has one row (containing overall model information). glm(`Closed?` ~ Length, data = nests, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.457 0.753 0.607 0.544 ## 2 Length -0.0677 0.0425 -1.59 0.112 glm(`Closed?` ~ Length, data = nests, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) %&gt;% augment() ## # A tibble: 95 x 10 ## .rownames Closed.

Example 4.1 In class – experience the Titanic going down. The Titanic is sinking. How long can you hold your breath? Every person is sinking and will also be their own time keeper (number of seconds the sinker can hold their breath). Because the Titanic is sinking slowly, the participants go under water asynchronously (i.e., at different times). Accrual period will last about a minute. When I say “stop” (about another minute), everyone should end their time clocks (this is the end of the follow-up period). Each participant will have a recorded time as well as an indicator as to whether or not they have died. Based on the data, we would like to calculate: 1. What is the probability of surviving 40 seconds? 2. What is the median survival time? 3. What is the average survival time? \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp; &amp;\\\\ &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The next example is given in your text (Kuiper and Sklar 2013 (chapter 9)) as part of the motivation for survival analysis. [I can’t figure out why it insists on being numbered wrong.] Example 6.1 Class chocolate melting activity Each student should be randomly assigned to a white or milk chocolate chip (flip a coin) When the instructor gives approval, students should place either a white or milk chocolate chip into their mouths and record the time until it completely melts. Treat the study as if it could only be done for a specified period of time (this may require some experimenting, but 60 seconds has worked well). If the actual time is less than 60 seconds, then the actual time will be complete. The student should submit the data (chip color, actual time, censoring status); 1=observed, 0=censored. Any chips that are “swallowed” prior to 60 seconds should be regarded as censored. Survival analysis is typically done with a prospective study (see censoring below) on a cohort of patients (observational or experimental) to determine some clinical outcome. We will also usually measure covariates of interest: treatment, clinical variables measured at recruitment, etc. Key Point: the outcome of interest (death, recurrence, etc.) may not occur Possible responses: Outcome of interest occurs Study ends The individual can no longer be measured (moves away, etc.) response fate and length of follow-up data suppose we are following n patients \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} t_i &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{time the } i^{th} \\mbox{ person dies}\\\\ m(t) &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{number of patients for whom } t_i &gt; t \\mbox{ (die later)}\\\\ d(t) &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{number of patients for whom } t_i \\leq t \\mbox{ (die sooner)}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.1 Time-to-event data 6.1.1 Survival Function The two main quantities of interest (i.e., parameters) are: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} S(t) &amp;=&amp; P(T &gt; t) = \\mbox{ probability of surviving until after time } t\\\\ D(t) &amp;=&amp; P(T \\leq t) = \\mbox{ probability of dying by time } t (= F(t) )\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Where \\(T\\) is a random variable representing the time to event; t is a number. If \\(t_i\\) is known for all i (no censoring), we can estimate \\(S(t)\\) and \\(D(t)\\) with \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{S}(t)_E &amp;=&amp; m(t)/n = \\mbox{ proportion alive at time } t\\\\ \\hat{D}(t)_E &amp;=&amp; d(t)/n = \\mbox{ proportion who have died by time } t\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.1.1.1 censoring right censoring: when the observation on an individual begins at a defined starting time and ends before the outcome of interest happens (this is the censoring for our model) left censoring: when the outcome of interest is known to have occurred before the study begins (infection of a disease, learning to count). Note that the event of interest has happened, unlike in right censoring where the event of interest has not happened. interval censoring; when the event of interest is only known to have occurred between two time points, but the precise time is not known. Important Assumption: survival time must be independent of any mechanism which causes censoring (called non-informative censoring). Censoring should be random: a person who is censored has the same probability of dying as non-censored people at given explanatory variables \\(\\underline{X}\\). Said differently: within any subgroup of interest, the subjects who are censored at time \\(t\\) should be representative of all the subjects in that subgroup who remained at risk at time \\(t\\) with respect to their survival experience. Not independent Subjects who drop out because they are extremely ill Subjects who drop out because of adverse effects of the treatment regimen Independent Subjects who drop out because the study ends Subjects who drop out because they move away Example 6.2 Suppose we have the following melting times (in seconds) of milk chocolate chips for 7 students where the maximum time allowed for the experiment was 60 seconds: To find the estimated proportion of chocolate chips that have not melted after 45 seconds we use the empirical survival function, \\(\\hat{S}(45)_E\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{S}(45)_E &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{number of chips that have not melted after 45 seconds}}{\\mbox{total number of chips in the sample}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 2/7 = 0.286\\\\ \\hat{S}(t)_E &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{number of individuals yet to experience the event at time } t}{\\mbox{number of individuals in the study}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{number of event times greater than } t}{\\mbox{number of individuals in the study}}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What if some of the observations are incomplete (i.e., censored)? Student 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Time \\(35^+\\) 30 \\(60^+\\) 45 25 55 \\(30^+\\) One way to deal with censored observations is to remove them from the study. We would consider our sample to be only those observations that have complete information. Student 2 4 5 6 Time 30 45 25 55 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{S}(45)_E &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{number of chips that have not melted after 45 seconds}}{\\mbox{total number of chips in the sample}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1/4 = 0.25\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] By treating censored observations as complete, we assume that the event times are shorter than what they actually are (thereby underestimating the true probability of survival). By removing the censored observations from the data, we lose information. By treating censored observations as complete we bias the estimate based on the remaining times; by ignoring censored observations, we reduce the power of the inferential model. 6.2 Kaplan-Meier Curves When a data set contains incomplete observations, the best estimator of the survival function is the Kaplan-Meier estimator, \\(\\hat{S}(t)_{KM}\\). We’ll create a few curves by hand, and then we’ll let R make them for us. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\cdots &lt; t_n &amp; &amp; \\mbox{are the ordered completed times}\\\\ n_k &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{number of patients known to be at risk at time (day) } t_i, \\mbox{ just before } [t_i, t_{i+1})\\\\ d_k &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{number of patients who die at time (day) } t_i, \\mbox{ in } [t_i, t_{i+1})\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For the patients alive at the beginning of the \\(t_i^{th}\\) day, the probability of surviving that day is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p_i = \\frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The probability that a patient survives to day 2 given that they survived to day 1 is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p_2 = \\frac{n_2 - d_2}{n_2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The probability that (at the outset) a patient survives to day 2 is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(T &gt; t_2) &amp;=&amp; P(T &gt; t_2 | T &gt; t_1) P(T &gt; t_1)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{n_1 - d_1}{n_1} \\frac{n_2 - d_2}{n_2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The probability of surviving the first t days is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{S}(t)_{KM} &amp;=&amp; \\prod_{i:t_i &lt; t} \\frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\prod_{i:t_i &lt; t} p_i\\\\ \\hat{D}(t)_{KM} = 1 - \\hat{S}(t)_{KM}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If there are no deaths at time \\(t_i\\), then \\((n_i -d_i) / n_i = 1\\). If there is no censoring at time \\(t_i\\), then \\(n_i - d_i = n_{i+1}\\). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve will be equivalent to the empirical survival curve: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{S}(t)_{KM} &amp;=&amp; \\prod_{i:t_i &lt; t} \\frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{n_1 - d_1}{n_1} \\frac{n_2 - d_2}{n_2} \\cdots \\frac{n_k - d_k}{n_k}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{m(t)}{n} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 6.3 milk chocolate times by hand. \\(t_i\\) \\(n_i\\) \\(d_i\\) \\(n_i - d_i\\) \\(\\frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i}\\) 25 7 1 6 6/7= 0.857 30 6 1 5 5/6 = 0.833 35 4 0 4 4/4 = 1 45 3 1 2 2/3 = 0.667 55 2 1 1 1/2=0.5 60 1 0 1 1/1=1 time interval \\(\\hat{S}(t)_{KM}\\) \\([0,25)\\) 1 \\([25,30)\\) 0.857 \\([30, 35)\\) 0.857 \\(\\cdot\\) 0.833 = 0.714 \\([35,45)\\) 0.714 \\(\\cdot\\) 1 = 0.714 \\([45,55)\\) 0.714 \\(\\cdot\\) 0.667 = 0.476 \\([55,60)\\) 0.476 \\(\\cdot\\) 0.5 = 0.238 6.2.1 CI for KM curve Recall: \\(\\hat{S}(t)_{KM} = \\prod_{k:t_k &lt; t} [ (n_k - d_k) / n_k]\\). Because \\(\\hat{S}(t)_{KM}\\) is just a product of counts, we can “easily” estimate the SE: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} s^2 _{\\hat{S}(t)_{KM}} = \\hat{S}(t)_{KM}^2 \\sum_{k:t_k &lt; t} \\frac{d_k}{n_k(n_k - d_k)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Your book uses the above SE and normal theory which does work, particularly with large sample sizes. However, with smaller sample sizes and at the ends of the survival curve (close to zero or one), the sampling distribution of the estimated KM curve will not be normal. Additionally if we try to apply normal theory, we’ll get something meaningless because the CI will go outside the bounds of 0 and 1. Fortunately, someone figured out a transformation for us! \\(l l \\hat{S}(t) = \\ln (-\\ln \\hat{S}(t)_{KM})\\) has a much more normal sampling distribution. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\sigma}^2(t) &amp;=&amp; SE( l l \\hat{S}(t))\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\sum_{k:t_k &lt; t} \\frac{d_k}{n_k(n_k - d_k)}}{\\bigg[\\sum_{k:t_k &lt; t} \\ln ( (n_k - d_k) / n_k) \\bigg]^2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] A 95 % CI for \\(\\ln ( -\\ln S(t))\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} ll\\hat{S}(t) \\pm 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t) \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{(a function of t!!!)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] A 95 % CI for \\(S(t)\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\bigg(\\hat{S}(t)_{KM}^{ \\exp(1.96\\hat{\\sigma}(t))}, \\hat{S}(t)_{KM}^{\\exp(-1.96\\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We can also find a CI for \\(D(t) = 1- S(t)\\) using: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\bigg(1 - \\hat{S}(t)_{KM}^{\\exp(-1.96\\hat{\\sigma}(t))}, 1 - \\hat{S}(t)_{KM}^{\\exp(1.96\\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Derivation of the above confidence intervals. Remember that \\(\\exp(a \\cdot b) = (\\exp(a))^b\\), we’ll need that below. A CI is an interval of values that captures the true parameter in 95 of samples. Let’s say that the complementary log-log interval from above happens to catch the true value of \\(S(t)\\). Then, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} ll\\hat{S}(t) - 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t) \\leq &amp; llS(t) &amp; \\leq ll\\hat{S}(t) + 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t) \\\\ \\exp(ll\\hat{S}(t) - 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t)) \\leq &amp; -lS(t) &amp; \\leq \\exp(ll\\hat{S}(t) + 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t)) \\\\ -l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(- 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))\\leq &amp; -lS(t) &amp; \\leq -l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t)) \\\\ l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(- 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))\\geq &amp; lS(t) &amp; \\geq l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t)) \\\\ l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))\\leq &amp; lS(t) &amp; \\leq l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(-1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t)) \\\\ \\exp(l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))) \\leq &amp; S(t) &amp; \\leq \\exp(l\\hat{S}(t)\\exp(-1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))) \\\\ \\exp(l\\hat{S}(t))^{\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\leq &amp; S(t) &amp; \\leq \\exp(l\\hat{S}(t))^{\\exp(-1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\\\ (\\hat{S}(t))^{\\exp(1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\leq &amp; S(t) &amp; \\leq (\\hat{S}(t))^{\\exp(-1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}(t))} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.2.1.1 Mean and Median values Mean Mean survival time is estimated as the area under the survival curve. The estimator is based upon the entire range of data. Some software uses only the data up to the last observed event (Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May 2008) point out that this biases the estimate of the mean downwards, and they recommend that the entire range of data be used. A large sample method is used to estimate the variance of the mean survival time and thus to construct a confidence interval (Andersen et al. 1996). (StatsDirect Limited 2016) In some ways, it is easier to conceptualize the mean as the average under the curve by thinking about calculating average as horizontal bars instead of vertical bars. The jumps along the y-axis are approximately 1/n, so each horizontal bar represents one of the individual deaths. See the example here: http://blog.data-miners.com/2010/06/why-is-area-under-survival-curve-equal.html \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\mu} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\hat{S}(t_i)_{KM} (t_{i+1} - t_i) &amp; \\mbox{if } t_n = t_m \\mbox{ (last obs is complete)}\\\\ \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\hat{S}(t_i)_{KM} (t_{i+1} - t_i) + \\hat{S}(t_m)_{KM}(t_n-t_m) &amp; \\mbox{if last obs is censored} \\end{array} \\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Each entry can be rearranged to be thought of as the proportion of people who die in the interval times the width of the interval: \\([\\hat{S}(t_{i-1})_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_{i})_{KM}]t_i\\). The difference, \\([\\hat{S}(t_{i-1})_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_{i})_{KM}]\\), gives the proportion of individuals who die in that time interval. Therefore, our estimate is a weighted average of the time points \\(t_i\\) where the weight is \\([\\hat{S}(t_{i-1})_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_{i})_{KM}]\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\mu} &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \\hat{S}(t_i)_{KM}(t_{i+1} - t_i)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\hat{S}(t_0)_{KM}(t_1 - t_0) + \\hat{S}(t_1)_{KM}(t_2 - t_1) + \\hat{S}(t_2)_{KM} (t_3 - t_2) + \\cdots + \\hat{S}(t_{m-1})_{KM} (t_m - t_{m-1}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; -t_0 \\hat{S}(t_0)_{KM} + t_1 ( \\hat{S}(t_0)_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_1)_{KM}) + \\cdots + t_{m-1}( \\hat{S}(t_{m-2})_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_{m-1})_{KM}) + t_m \\hat{S}(t_{m-1})_{KM}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0 + t_1 ( \\hat{S}(t_0)_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_1)_{KM}) + \\cdots + t_{m-1}( \\hat{S}(t_{m-2})_{KM} - \\hat{S}(t_{m-1})_{KM}) + t_m ( \\hat{S}(t_{m-1})_{KM} - 0)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{a weighted average of the times} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Median Since the distribution of survival times tend to be positively skewed, the median is often the preferred summary measure of location of the distribution. Once the survivor function has been estimated, it is straightforward to obtain an estimate of the median survival time. That is, the time beyond which 50 % of the individuals in the population under study are expected to survive, and is given by the value \\(t_{(50)}\\) such that \\(S(t_{(50)}) = 0.5\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{t}_{(p)} = \\mbox{smallest complete event time, } t_i, \\mbox{ in the sample such that } \\hat{S}(t_i)_{KM} \\leq 1-p/100 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(\\hat{S}(t_i)_{KM}\\) then gives the time at which at least p % of events have occurred. There are also ways of compute confidence intervals for percentiles. We won’t cover those here. 6.2.2 Log-rank Test As before, we’d like to know if two treatments produce the same probability of survival (how did we do that with logistic regression? significance of the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient). Here: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: &amp;&amp; S_1(t) = S_2(t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall t \\mbox{ parameters!}\\\\ H_1: &amp;&amp; S_1(t) \\ne S_2(t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ for some } t\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We want to test whether the curves are the same over all \\(t\\) (or different at any \\(t\\)). Let’s consider a particular time, the \\(j^{th}\\) time point: died \\(d_{1j}\\) \\(d_{2j}\\) \\(D_j\\) survived \\(n_{1j} - d_{1j}\\) \\(n_{2j} - d_{2j}\\) \\(N_j - D_j\\) \\(n_{1j}\\) \\(n_{2j}\\) \\(N_j\\) Because it’s a \\(2x2\\) table with fixed margins, we only need to consider one group. If survival is similar for the two groups, we’d expect: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} d_{ij} &amp;\\approx&amp; \\frac{D_j}{N_j}n_{1j}\\\\ d_{ij} &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{observed}\\\\ \\frac{D_j}{N_j} n_{1j} &amp;=&amp; E(d_{1j} | D_j) \\\\ var(d_{ij}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{n_{1j} n_{2j} D_j (N_j - D_j)}{N_j^2(N_j-1)}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where the variance is derived from the hypergeometric distribution. To estimate the overall difference between the observed and expected death counts: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_j d_{1j} - \\sum_j E(d_{1j} | D_j) = \\sum_j d_{1j} - \\sum_j \\frac{D_j}{N_j}n_{1j} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The overall variability: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_j var(d_{1j}|D_j) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The test statistic we use to compare the observed and expected frequency of deaths. (Sum over all of the death (or recurrence) times.) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} T = \\frac{(|\\sum_j d_{1j} - \\sum_j E(d_{1j} | D_j)| - 0.5)^2}{\\sum_j var(d_{1j}|D_j)} \\sim \\chi^2_1 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] What if we had had \\(g\\) groups (instead of 2)? We’ll have \\(g-1\\) “death” values. Consider the test statistic above, call it \\(T_1\\). We want to sum \\(T_i, i=1,2, \\ldots, g-1\\), but the variances are now correlated (values have to sum to \\(D_k\\))… so the whole thing is slightly more complicated. (Collett 2015 (section 2.6)) The Wilcoxon test is very similar to the log-rank test, but it uses a different derivation for the variance, and therefore a different denominator and test statistic. The log-rank test is more powerful than the Wilcoxon, but the log-rank test requires the proportional hazards assumption. Wilcoxon test does not require the proportional hazards assumption, but it does require that one curve is always bigger than the other. Neither work if the curves cross. Other technical conditions are that the sample size should be “big enough.” The sample size is dependent on the number of deaths. No specific criteria, but the results are asymptotic, so the p-values converge to the actual probabilities as the number of deaths gets larger. 6.3 Hazard Functions Another important idea in survival analysis is the hazard function or instantaneous death rate. Let T be the random variable representing death time. [Your text implicitly redefines \\(S(t) = P(T \\geq t)\\) which is inconsistent but not fundamentally problematic.] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h(t)&amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P(\\mbox{patient dies by time } t + \\Delta t | \\mbox{alive at } t)}{\\Delta t}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P(T &lt; t + \\Delta t | T \\geq t)}{\\Delta t}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P(t \\leq T &lt; t + \\Delta t | T \\geq t)}{\\Delta t}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{P(t \\leq T &lt; t + \\Delta t )}{P(T \\geq t) \\Delta t}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{S(t) - S(t + \\Delta t)}{S(t) \\Delta t}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} -\\frac{S(t + \\Delta t) - S(t)}{\\Delta t}\\frac{1}{S(t)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -S&#39;(t) \\frac{1}{S(t)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t))\\\\ S(t) &amp;=&amp; \\exp \\{ - \\int^t_0 h(x) dx \\}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] How do different functions of \\(h\\) affect the survival curve, \\(S\\)? \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h(t) = 0 &amp;&amp;\\Rightarrow \\mbox{ no risk of death at time } t\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\Rightarrow S(t) \\mbox{ is flat at } t\\\\ h(t) &gt; &gt;&amp;&amp; \\Rightarrow S(t) \\mbox{ is rapidly declining in } t\\\\ h(t) =k &amp;&amp; \\Rightarrow S(t) = e^{-kt} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.3.0.1 hazard function as a constant If \\(h(t) =k \\rightarrow S(t) = e^{-kt}\\). Plots of different hazard functions and their corresponding survival functions. 6.3.1 Estimating \\(h(t)\\) ala Kaplan-Meier \\(h(t)\\) is the rate at which individuals in the population experience the event in the next instant of time, conditional on surviving to time \\(t\\). The estimated hazard curve can only extend to the last complete event time, otherwise the denominator is infinitely large. Also, keep in mind that \\(h(t)\\) is very hard to estimate, and \\(\\hat{h}_{KM}(t)\\) can be erratic. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{P}(t_i \\leq T &lt; t_{i+1} | T \\geq t_i) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{d_i}{n_i} = \\hat{p}_i\\\\ \\hat{h}_{KM}(t) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\hat{p}_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ t_{i+1} \\leq t &lt; t_i\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.3.2 Proportional Hazards Suppose that \\(h_0(t)\\) and \\(h_1(t)\\) are the hazard functions for patients on control and experimental treatments. The two groups have {proportional hazards} if \\(h_1(t) = R h_0(t)\\) for some constant R: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{h_1(t)}{h_0(t)} = R \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall t \\end{eqnarray*}\\] R is called the hazard ratio. \\(h_0(t)\\) can be anything as long as \\(h_1(t)\\) is proportional. Note in the pictures below that no one dies between 3 and 7 days, the survival curves are flat over that interval. Consider the notion of risk of death: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{risk of death by } t + \\Delta t \\mbox{ given alive at } t= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} h_0(t) \\Delta t &amp; \\mbox{control}\\\\ h_1(t) \\Delta t &amp; \\mbox{experiment} \\end{array} \\right. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{\\mbox{risk of dying for experim}}{\\mbox{risk of dying control}} = \\frac{h_1(t) \\Delta t}{h_0(t) \\Delta t} = \\frac{h_1(t) }{h_0(t) } = R \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Ratio of hazard functions can be thought of as the (i.e., at a time \\(t\\)). 6.3.3 Cox PH Regression Analysis 6.3.3.1 Simple proportional hazards model ASSUMING proportional hazards! Let \\(h_0(t)\\) be the hazard function for the control group. \\(x_i\\) =1 if the \\(i^{th}\\) patient receives treatment; 0 if the \\(i^{th}\\) patient receives the control. A big value of \\(\\beta\\) means that the event is more likely to happen. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_i(t) &amp;=&amp; h_0(t) e^{\\beta x_i} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} h_0(t) e^\\beta &amp; \\mbox{experim}\\\\ h_0(t) &amp; \\mbox{control} \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\mbox{inst. RR} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{h_0(t) e^\\beta}{h_0(t)} = e^\\beta\\\\ S_i(t) &amp;=&amp; (S_0(t))^{e^\\beta}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We don’t yet know how to run this model and estimate the parameters, but still, we can probably do it. Right? We run a Cox proportional hazards model, get \\(b\\), and estimate the RR using: \\(\\hat{RR} = e^{b}\\)! It turns out that for large samples (as with logistic regression, the CI and tests below are again called Wald CI and tests), \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} b \\sim N: &amp;&amp; \\\\ &amp;&amp; 95\\% \\mbox{ CI for } \\beta: b \\pm 1.96 SE(b)\\\\ &amp;&amp; 95\\% \\mbox{ CI for } RR: (e^{b - 1.96 SE(b)}, e^{b + 1.96 SE(b)})\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] And we can test RR by using \\(\\beta\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0:&amp;&amp; \\beta=0 \\iff RR = 1\\\\ Z &amp;=&amp; \\frac{b - 0 }{SE(b)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.3.3.2 Estimating the proportional hazards coefficients The main point of proportional hazards is that if we have proportional hazards, then we don’t actually need to know the hazard function in order to estimate the coefficients which affect the survival function. [We divide out the hazard function.] Intervals between death times convey no information about the relationship between hazard and explanatory variables (including treatment). We are also assuming that we have no ties for our death times. [Importantly, we assume that the proportional hazards assumption holds over all \\(t\\).] \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(i^{th} \\mbox{ indiv, w/}x_i, \\mbox{ dies at } t_i | \\mbox{one death at } t_i) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{P(i^{th} \\mbox{ indiv w/}x_i \\mbox{ dies at } t_i )}{P(\\mbox{at least one death at } t_i)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{hazard at } t_i}{\\mbox{sum over all patients at risk at time } t_i}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{h_i(t_i)}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_i} h_k (t_i)} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_i} e^{\\beta x_k}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] As with logistic regression (and linear regression!) we’ll use maximum likelihood to estimate the parameter(s). (The product is over only patients who have death times recorded, not censored times). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\beta) &amp;=&amp; \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_i} e^{\\beta x_k}}\\\\ \\delta_i &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\mbox{death}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{censored} \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ L(\\beta) &amp;=&amp; \\prod_{i=1}^n \\Bigg( \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_i} e^{\\beta x_k}} \\Bigg)^{\\delta_i}\\\\ \\ln L(\\beta) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_i \\bigg[ \\beta x_i - \\ln (\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_i} e^{\\beta x_k}) \\bigg] \\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(b\\) is found using numerical methods (as it was with logistic regression). Example 4.3 Consider the following data from a prostate cancer study. The study was performed as a randomized clinical trail to compare treatments for prostatic cancer, and was begun in 1967 by the Veteran’s Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group. The trial was double blind and two of the treatments used were a placebo and 1.0 mg of diethylstilbestrol (DES). The time origin of the study is the date on which a patient was randomized to a treatment, and the end-point is the death of the patient from prostate cancer. The full data set is given in Andrews and Herzberg (1985), but the data used in this example are from patients presenting with Stage III cancer and given in Collett (2015) (page 8). library(survival) prostate &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;PROSTATE.csv&quot;) head(prostate) ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## Treatment Time Status Age Haem Size Gleason ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 65 0 67 13.4 34 8 ## 2 2 61 0 60 14.6 4 10 ## 3 2 60 0 77 15.6 3 8 ## 4 1 58 0 64 16.2 6 9 ## 5 2 51 0 65 14.1 21 9 ## 6 1 51 0 61 13.5 8 8 coxph(Surv(Time,Status) ~ Treatment, data = prostate) ## Call: ## coxph(formula = Surv(Time, Status) ~ Treatment, data = prostate) ## ## coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p ## Treatment -1.9780 0.1384 1.0982 -1.801 0.0717 ## ## Likelihood ratio test=4.55 on 1 df, p=0.03293 ## n= 38, number of events= 6 coxph(Surv(Time,Status) ~ Treatment, data = prostate) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 1 x 7 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Treatment -1.98 1.10 -1.80 0.0717 -4.13 0.175 coxph(Surv(Time,Status) ~ Treatment, data = prostate) %&gt;% glance() ## # A tibble: 1 x 15 ## n nevent statistic.log p.value.log statistic.sc p.value.sc ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 38 6 4.55 0.0329 4.42 0.0355 ## # … with 9 more variables: statistic.wald &lt;dbl&gt;, p.value.wald &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # r.squared &lt;dbl&gt;, r.squared.max &lt;dbl&gt;, concordance &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # std.error.concordance &lt;dbl&gt;, logLik &lt;dbl&gt;, AIC &lt;dbl&gt;, BIC &lt;dbl&gt; Note 1: There is no intercept in the model. The intercept is contained within the \\(h_0(t)\\) parameter. Note 2: Nowhere have we made any assumptions about the form of \\(h_0(t)\\). Note 3: To estimate \\(h_0(t)\\), we use the pointwise values, just like Kaplan-Meier plots (\\(\\tau_j = t_{(j+1)} - t_j):\\) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_0(t_j) = \\frac{d_j}{n_j \\tau_j} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If there are covariates, the estimation gets much more complicated. Note 4: The logrank statistic can be derived as the score test for the Cox proportional hazards model comparing two groups. It is therefore approximately equivalent to the likelihood ratio test statistics from that model (Collett 2015 (section 3.9, page 102-106)). Additionally, the log-rank test is most powerful against the alternative that the hazard of death at any given time for an individual in one group is proportional to the hazard at that time for a similar individual in the other group (i.e., the proportional hazards assumption). (Collett 2015 (section 2.5.4, pg 44-45)) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: h_1(t) = h_2(t)\\\\ H_1: h_1(t) = R h_2(t) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note 5: You need proportional hazards to do the inference (otherwise your p-values are meaningless!). The technical assumptions for the Cox Proportional Hazards model are: Observations are independent (this is almost always an important assumption in all of statistical inference) Proportional hazards: the hazard ratios are not dependent on time. Independent censoring: the censored observations have the same survival prospects as the non-censored participants. 6.3.3.3 Cox PH Multiple Regression Analysis Extending the simple proportional hazards model to include multiple covariates. Let \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{iq}\\) be the \\(q\\) covariates for person \\(i\\). We define the baseline hazard as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_0(t) &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{hazard for patients with covariates } x_{i1}=x_{i2}=\\cdots=x_{iq} = 0\\\\ h_i(t) &amp;=&amp; h_0(t) e^{\\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + \\cdots + \\beta_q x_{iq}}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] is the hazard function for the \\(i^{th}\\) patient. As before, we can consider nested models and compare their likelihoods. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} -2 \\ln \\frac{L_{\\mbox{reduced model}}}{L_{\\mbox{full model}}} &amp;\\sim&amp; \\chi^2_{\\Delta p}\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\\\ 2 ( \\ln L_{\\mbox{full model}} - \\ln L_{\\mbox{reduced model}} ) &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{test stat}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 5.2 Framingham Heart Study (Dupont 2009 (section 3.10)) Long-term follow-up and cardiovascular risk factor data on almost 5000 residents of the town of Framingham, MA. Recruitment started in 1948 (went for 40+ years). These data are 4699 patients who were free of coronary heart disease at their baseline exam: variable code sex = gender coded as 1=if subject is male 0= if subject is female sbp = systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mm Hg dbp = diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in mm Hg scl = serum cholesterol (SCL) in mg/100ml chdfate = 1= if the patient develops CHD at the end of follow-up 0= otherwise followup = the subject’s follow-up in days age = age in years bmi = body mass index (BMI) =weight/height\\(^2\\) in kg/m\\(^2\\) month = month of year in which baseline exam occurred id = a patient identification variable (numbered 1 to 4699) We look at the K-M survival curves broken down by diastolic blood pressure. The logrank statistic comparing all 7 groups is highly significant (\\(p &lt; 10^{-52}\\)), and the pairwise logrank tests for adjacent pairs of risk groups are also all significant (though be careful with multiple comparisons!). heart &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;framingham.csv&quot;) heart &lt;- heart %&gt;% mutate(dbpf = ifelse(dbp &lt;= 60, &quot;under60&quot;, ifelse(dbp &lt;=70, &quot;60-70&quot;, ifelse(dbp &lt;= 80, &quot;70-80&quot;, ifelse(dbp &lt;=90, &quot;80-90&quot;, ifelse(dbp &lt;=100, &quot;90-100&quot;, ifelse(dbp &lt;=110, &quot;100-110&quot;, &quot;over110&quot;))))))) %&gt;% mutate(dbpf = factor(dbpf, levels = c(&quot;under60&quot;, &quot;60-70&quot;, &quot;70-80&quot;,&quot;80-90&quot;, &quot;90-100&quot;,&quot;100-110&quot;,&quot;over110&quot;)), sex = ifelse(sex == 1, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;)) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} dbp_{ij} &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\mbox{if the } i^{th} \\mbox{ patient is in DBP group } j\\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ male_i &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\mbox{if the } i^{th} \\mbox{ patient is male}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{if the } i^{th} \\mbox{ patient is female}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Table 7.1 Using a proportional hazards model for estimating the hazard ratio associated with each blood pressure group, we get: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_i(t) &amp;=&amp; h_0(t) \\exp \\bigg\\{ \\beta_2 dbp_{i2} + \\beta_3 dbp_{i3} + \\beta_4 dbp_{i4} + \\beta_5 dbp_{i5} + \\beta_6 dbp_{i6} + \\beta_7 dbp_{i7} \\bigg\\}\\\\ h_i(t) &amp;=&amp; h_0(t) \\exp \\bigg\\{ \\sum_{j=2}^7 \\beta_j dbp_{ij} \\bigg\\} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We can use the model with dbp as categorical to check whether dbp could be used as a continuous variable. Indeed, it seems that the model is linear (in ln(HR)) with respect to dbp. One reason, however, to keep the variable broken into groups is because of the way the results are nicely laid out for each group. coxph(Surv(followup,chdfate) ~ dbpf, data = heart) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 dbpf60-70 0.677 0.247 2.74 6.11e- 3 0.193 1.16 ## 2 dbpf70-80 0.939 0.241 3.90 9.56e- 5 0.467 1.41 ## 3 dbpf80-90 1.12 0.241 4.64 3.54e- 6 0.645 1.59 ## 4 dbpf90-100 1.51 0.243 6.22 4.97e-10 1.04 1.99 ## 5 dbpf100-110 1.84 0.254 7.23 4.86e-13 1.34 2.34 ## 6 dbpfover110 2.25 0.271 8.29 1.18e-16 1.72 2.78 Table 7.2 As our next step, we can consider adding gender as a multiplicative effect to our model. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_i(t) &amp;=&amp; h_0(t) \\exp \\bigg\\{ \\sum_{j=2}^7 \\beta_j dbp_{ij} + \\gamma male_i \\bigg\\} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We say the effects are multiplicative because we are adding in the exponent, so any effect due to gender will be multiplied with the effect due to dbp. How do we tell - from the results - that interaction wasn’t modeled? Look at the hazard ratios, are they consistent when comparing one variable and keeping the other one constant? That is, check to see if the HR for two different levels of dbp is the same regardless of whether men or women are considered. The change in deviance is 133 (\\(H_0: \\gamma =0\\)), so with one degree of freedom, the p-value is very small.

The evidence of interaction is statistically significant. Note the marked differences between the estimates in table 7.2 and 7.3. The interactive model indicates that the effect of gender on the risk of CHD is greatest for people with low or moderate blood pressure and diminishes as blood pressure rises.

The HR in Table 7.4 are substantially smaller than those in Table 7.3. It is important to realize that the HR in Table 7.4 compare people of the same age, body mass index, and serum cholesterol, while those of Table 7.3 compare people without regard to other variables. It is not surprising that the unadjusted HR are inflated due to the confounding variables. Goal: to predict CHD \\(\\rightarrow\\) because it’s easier to measure blood pressure than cholesterol, we may just prefer to use the unadjusted model. Goal: to establish a causal link \\(\\rightarrow\\) we must adjust for all possible confounding variables.

What does that mean in terms of the survival function? \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_1 (t) &amp;=&amp; h_0 (t) e^\\beta\\\\ S(t) &amp;=&amp; e^{-\\int_0^t h(x) dx}\\\\ S_0(t) &amp;=&amp; e^{-\\int_0^t h_0(x) dx}\\\\ S_1(t) &amp;=&amp; e^{-\\int_0^t h_0(x)e^\\beta dx}\\\\ S_1(t) &amp;=&amp; e^{- e^\\beta \\int_0^t h_0(x) dx}\\\\ S_1(t) &amp;=&amp; \\bigg[ e^{- \\int_0^t h_0(x) dx} \\bigg]^{e^\\beta}\\\\ \\ln(S_1(t)) &amp;=&amp; e^\\beta \\ln [e^{- \\int_0^t h_0(x) dx}]\\\\ -\\ln(S_1(t)) &amp;=&amp; e^\\beta [-\\ln(S_0(t))]\\\\ \\ln(-\\ln(S_1(t))) &amp;=&amp; \\beta + \\ln [-\\ln(S_0(t))]\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.3.4.1 Test 1 for PH That is to say, the \\(\\ln (- \\ln\\) survival curves) should be parallel and differ only by a y-intercept constant of \\(\\beta\\). Note that if \\(h_0(t)\\) is a constant (i.e., \\(h_i(t) = const e^\\beta\\)), then \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} S(t) &amp;=&amp; e^{-\\int_0^t h(x) dx}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; e^{-e^\\beta t}\\\\ \\ln S(t) &amp;=&amp; -e^\\beta t\\\\ - \\ln S(t) &amp;=&amp; e^\\beta t\\\\ \\ln(- \\ln S(t)) &amp;=&amp; \\beta + \\ln(t)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Which is to say that if \\(ln(- ln S(t))\\) is linear in \\(\\ln(t)\\), then \\(h_0(t)\\) is not only PH but also constant for all \\(t\\). 6.3.4.2 Time dependent covariates If the PH assumption is violated, then we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{h_i(t)}{h_0(t)} = g(t) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] some function of \\(t\\). Consider the following model (the function of time is completely specified, but it is just one possibility for the dependence relationship): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} x_{i1} &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; treatment\\\\ 0 &amp; control \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ x_{i2} &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} t &amp; treatment\\\\ 0 &amp; control\\\\ \\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The relative hazard becomes: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} h_i(t) = e^{\\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2}} h_0(t)\\\\ \\frac{h_1(t)}{h_0(t)} = e^{\\beta_1 +\\beta_2 t}\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If \\(\\beta_2 &lt; 0\\), the relative hazard decreases with time. If \\(\\beta_2 &gt; 0\\), the relative hazard increases with time. 6.3.4.3 Test 2 for PH The PH test of interest will be: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: \\beta_2 = 0 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] It isn’t a Wald test, but it is the same general idea (in R: cox.zph). [The variable in the denominator of the likelihood (for calculating the MLE) will have different values at different times.] An alternative form of the test is to call: \\(x_{i2} = t \\ \\ \\forall t\\) and let \\[h_i(t) = e^{\\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i1} x_{i2}} h_0(t).\\] If there is time dependency in the model, then the coxph analysis won’t be accurate. 6.3.4.4 Schoenfeld Residuals Recall: under the Cox model, the probability that any particular member \\(i\\) fails at time \\(t_j\\) is: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(i^{th} \\mbox{ indiv w/}x_i \\mbox{ dies at } t_j | \\mbox{at least one death at } t_j) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{P(i^{th} \\mbox{ indiv w/}x_i \\mbox{ dies at } t_j )}{P(\\mbox{at least one death at } t_j)}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\mbox{hazard at } t_i}{\\mbox{sum over all patients at risk at time } t_j}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{h_i(t_j)}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_j} h_k (t_j)} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_j} e^{\\beta x_k}}\\\\ w_j(\\beta, t_j) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{\\sum_{k:t_k \\geq t_j} e^{\\beta x_k}} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Using the weights above, we can calculate the average value for the \\(l^{th}\\) covariate (i.e., explanatory variable): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\bar{x}_l (\\beta,t_j) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k: t_k \\geq t_j} x_{kl} w_j(\\beta, t_j) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The Schoenfeld Residual for \\(x_l\\) and any subject \\(i\\) who is still alive at time \\(t_j\\), is the difference between the covariate \\(x_{il}\\) for that subject and the weighted average of the covariates in the risk set: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{Schoenfeld resid }_i = x_{il} - \\bar{x}_l(\\beta, t_i) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that the calculation is for the \\(i^{th}\\) subject which means there was a death at time \\(t_i\\). 6.3.4.5 Test 3 for PH The idea is for the plot to be flat. What if there is a strong linear trend for the residuals? What would that say about the time dependency? Imagine a scatterplot where the residual is very positively linearly associated with time. If \\(t_i &gt; &gt;\\) then \\(x_i\\) is much bigger than expected; if $t_i &lt; &lt; $ then \\(x_i\\) is much smaller than expected. That is, the covariate of interest changes over time and its effect on the risk of survival does, too. 6.3.4.6 Solutions crossing If the hazard functions (or survivor functions!) cross over time, the PH assumption is violated. help What should we do? Don’t do coxph, just fit K-M curves separately and perform a log-rank test. Start at \\(t^*\\), the crossing point. Fit different models for before \\(t^*\\) and after \\(t^*\\). Fit a model with a time dependent covariate. Creative analysis: instead of tumor size, use % change over a set period of time. examples of PH violations over time, effect lessens (short term benefits) tumor size at endpoint is more predictive than tumor size at entrance. clinical variables that change over time (lung capacity, weight, white blood cell count) exposure variables (pollution, UV rays, etc.) age, temperature 6.3.4.7 Log linearity We’ve also assumed that the log of the hazard ratio is linear in the covariates. That a one unit change in any covariate has the same effect on the log of the HR (at any level of the covariate). Just like with logistic regression, this assumption is hard to check. However, we can see how the modeling performs by checking to see if quadratic (or other higher order terms) are significant in the model. Another possibility is to categorize a continuous predictor to check PH assumptions as above. 6.4 Other stuff 6.4.1 Sample Size Calculation 6.4.1.1 Sample Size for Two Independent Sample Means Inference Taking a step back to consider a slightly simpler inference (two sample mean), let’s say we want a size of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) and a power of \\(1-\\beta=0.8\\). What does that mean? How do they relate to the type I and type II errors? Draw some pictures. We’re talking about the only thing we can control: the sample size. We cannot actually control the truth of the hypotheses, the extent of the difference in in \\(H_0\\) versus \\(H_A\\), or the variability of the underlying population. We can control the sample size. The larger your sample size, the easier it is to identify a true alternative hypothesis (that is, the higher the power). In order to estimate the needed sample size, you need to know how often you are willing to make type I errors, how often you are willing to make type II errors, and how big of a difference between \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_A\\) you would like to determine. Without all three of those components, it is impossible to determine the sample size. If you read that a sample size calculation has been done, they must report the associated size, power, and difference (or their calculation will be meaningless). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\\\ H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\ne 0 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We have to make some assumptions. We assume that the size is 0.05, the power is 0.8, and the alternative hypothesis is \\(D = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\). For this case, let’s also assume that \\(\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2=\\sigma\\) and \\(n_1=n_2=n\\). Without loss of generality, let’s say \\(\\overline{Y}_1 - \\overline{Y}_2 &gt; 0\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P\\bigg(\\frac{\\overline{Y}_1 - \\overline{Y}_2 - 0}{\\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}} &gt; 1.96 \\bigg| \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0 \\bigg) &amp;=&amp; 0.025\\\\ P(\\overline{Y}_1 - \\overline{Y}_2 &gt; 1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n} \\bigg| \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0) &amp;=&amp; 0.025\\\\ P(\\overline{Y}_1 - \\overline{Y}_2 &gt; 1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n} \\bigg| \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = D) &amp;\\geq&amp; 0.8\\\\ P\\bigg(\\frac{\\overline{Y}_1 - \\overline{Y}_2 - D}{\\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}} &gt; \\frac{1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}-D}{\\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}} \\bigg| \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = D \\bigg) &amp;\\geq&amp; 0.8\\\\ P\\bigg(Z &gt; \\frac{1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}-D}{\\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}} \\bigg) &amp;\\geq&amp; 0.8\\\\ \\frac{1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}-D}{\\sigma \\sqrt{1/n + 1/n}} &amp;\\leq&amp; Z_{0.8}\\\\ 1.96 \\sigma \\sqrt{2/n} - D &amp;\\leq&amp; Z_{0.8} \\sigma \\sqrt{2/n}\\\\ 2.845 \\sigma \\sqrt{2/n} &amp;\\leq&amp; D\\\\ n &amp;\\geq&amp; \\frac{16 \\sigma^2}{D^2} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Again, if we want to be able to find a 2 point difference in unrestricted versus deprived mean visual acuity scores, (\\(\\sigma=14\\), equal sample sizes): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} n &amp;\\geq&amp; \\frac{16 \\cdot 14^2}{4}\\\\ &amp;\\geq&amp; 784 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 6.4.1.2 Sample Size for Survival model The sample size calculations below are derived from the inference done with a log-rank statistics comparing two groups. The total number of deaths required to detect a difference in groups with a size of \\(\\alpha\\) and a power of \\(1-\\beta\\) is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} d = \\frac{(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta)^2}{\\pi_1 \\pi_2 \\theta^2_R} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\pi_1\\) is the proportion of the sample in group 1, \\(\\pi_2\\) is the proportion of the sample in group 2, and \\(\\theta_R\\) is the log hazard ratio to detect. (Derivation in Collett (2015) pg 256.) Consider the following sample size calculator. The variables included are slightly different, but give the same general structure to the calculation. For example, the equation above calculates the number of deaths. The applet calculates the number of samples (where \\(d = p_E \\cdot n\\)). http://powerandsamplesize.com/Calculators/Test-Time-To-Event-Data/Cox-PH-Equivalence 6.4.1.3 Significance level vs. Power vs. Sample Size Sig level \\(\\alpha\\): we set our type I error rate power \\(1-\\beta\\): probability of not making a type II error. To set the power, we would need to know the sample size, significance level, and the clinically important difference that we wish to detect (effect size). sample size n: To set the sample size, we need \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and effect size “The trial has 90% power” is meaningless “With 500 subjects per group, the trial has 90% power to detect a decrease of 10mmHg in blood pressure due to the new treatment at a 0.05 significance level.” 6.4.2 Study Design Randomized, controlled trial Factorial design Random allocation (within a factorial design) allows for estimation of interaction between treatments Physicians’ health study was factorial with aspirin (to measure myocardial infarction) and beta carotene (cancer) Can include 3 or more treatments (but would need large sample sizes to measure anything) treatment A Yes No Yes Both A &amp; B only B treatment B No only A neither Cross-over design: all participants receive both treatments (e.g., surgery and chemotherapy) Each patient serves as their own control (need fewer samples) Often cross-over effect from the initial treatment \\(\\swarrow\\) \\(\\searrow\\) Group 1 Group 2 \\(\\downarrow\\) (1) \\(\\downarrow\\) (1) Drug A \\(\\stackrel{(2)}{\\rightarrow}\\) Drug B \\(\\stackrel{(2)}{\\hookleftarrow}\\) Noncompliance Patients will switch on their own! How do you analyze the data? Analyze according to assigned treatment (intent-to-treat). Crossover does not happen randomly and is well known to be associated to outcome. Can perform a secondary analysis on only those patients who stayed on treatment. Example: surgery and radiation 6.4.2.1 subgroup analysis Refers to analyzing a subset of patients in a trial separately (e.g., gender, race, family background, etc.) Important for: clinical decision making, regulatory requirements, hypothesis generation Problems: insufficient power. If powered for overall treatment effect, it will be underpowered to detect similar effects in subgroups. multiple comparisons. If you torture your data long enough, eventually it will confess to anything. whenever possible, subgroup analysis should be defined a priori in the protocol 6.4.2.2 Some topics worth investigating Meta Analysis (Green et al. 2016) General Thoughts on Clinical Trials for cancer (Green et al. 2016) Stratified Cox Model (E.

[ProPublica] looked at more than 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, and compared their predicted recidivism rates with the rate that actually occurred over a two-year period. When most defendants are booked in jail, they respond to a COMPAS questionnaire.

In this example we are testing proportionality by looking at the interactions with log(time). The column rho is the Pearson product-moment correlation between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and log(time) for each covariate. The last row contains the global test for all the interactions tested at once. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a violation of the proportionality assumption. 6.5.6 Checking proportional hazards with cox.zph cox.zph(coxph(Surv(timefollow,event) ~ score_factor, data=recidKM)) ## rho chisq p ## score_factorHigh 0.010310 3.26e-01 0.568 ## score_factorMedium -0.000149 6.79e-05 0.993 ## GLOBAL NA 4.28e-01 0.807 cox.zph(coxph(Surv(timefollow,event) ~ score_factor, data=recidKM), transform=&quot;log&quot;) ## rho chisq p ## score_factorHigh 0.03092 2.930 0.0869 ## score_factorMedium 0.00944 0.272 0.6019 ## GLOBAL NA 3.045 0.2182 cox.zph(coxph(Surv(timefollow,event) ~ score_factor + race + age + sex, data=recidKM)) ## rho chisq p ## score_factorHigh -0.0113 0.3962 0.5291 ## score_factorMedium -0.0174 0.9433 0.3314 ## raceCaucasian -0.0454 6.3353 0.0118 ## age -0.0429 5.6270 0.0177 ## sexMale -0.0056 0.0958 0.7570 ## GLOBAL NA 13.7513 0.0173 Note the big p-values. We do not reject the null hypothesis, so we conclude that there is no evidence of non-proportional hazards. If for example, the model seemed to be non-proportional on time but proportional on log(time), you might consider transforming the time variable (i.e., taking the natural log) in your original model. The function cox.zph creates a cox.zph object that contains a list of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. The ordering of the residuals in the list is the same order as the predictors were entered in the cox model. So, the first element of the list corresponds to the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for married, the second element corresponds to the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for person, and so forth. The cox.zph object can be used in a plot function. By specifying a particular element of the list it is possible to generate plots of residuals for individual predictors. Leaving out the list number results in plots for all the predictors being generated at one time. In the plots a non-zero slope is evidence against proportionality. The horizontal line at y=0 has been added for reference. ggcoxzph(cox.zph(coxph(Surv(timefollow,event) ~ score_factor + race + age + sex, data=recidKM))) 6.5.7 Coxph diagnostics … look into all the different arguments of the function! ggcoxdiagnostics(coxph(Surv(timefollow,event) ~ score_factor + race + age + sex, data=recidKM)) References "],

(pre-study odds: R; phase III trials have better odds than microarray studies) Corollary 4 The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. (increased bias) Corollary 5 The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. (increased bias) Corollary 6 The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true. (increased \\(n\\)) 7.2 Multiple Comparisons As you might expect, if you have 10 groups, all of which come from the same population, you might wrongly conclude that some of the means are significantly different. If you try pairwise comparisons on all 10 groups, you’ll have \\({10 \\choose 2} = 45\\) comparisons. Out of the 45 CI, you’d expect 2.25 of them to not contain the true difference (of zero); equivalently, you’d expect 2.25 tests to reject the true \\(H_0\\). In an overall test of comparing all 10 groups simultaneously, you can’t use size as a performance measure anymore. FWER = \\(P(V\\geq1)\\) The Familywise Error Rate (FWER) is the probability of making one or more type I errors in a series of multiple tests. In the example above (with 10 comparisons), you would almost always make at least one type I error if you used a size of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). So, your FWER would be close to 1. Methods exist for controlling the FWER instead of the size (\\(\\alpha\\)). 7.2.1 Bonferroni The Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons is used to control the FWER. Assume all our tests are null \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} A_1 &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{event reject test 1}\\\\ P(A_1) &amp;=&amp; \\alpha^*\\\\ A_2 &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{event reject test 2}\\\\ P(A_2) &amp;=&amp; \\alpha^*\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We want to bound the probability that all our tests don’t commit a type 1 error (that is, none of them reject). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P( A_1 \\mbox{ or } A_2) &amp;=&amp; P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \\mbox{ and } A_2)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\alpha^* + \\alpha^* - ???\\\\ &amp; \\leq&amp; 2 \\alpha^* \\\\ FWER = P(\\mbox{at least one rejects}) &amp;\\leq&amp; 2 \\alpha^*\\\\ \\mbox{let} &amp;&amp; P(A_1) = P(A_2) = \\alpha^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\\\ FWER &amp;\\leq&amp; \\alpha \\end{eqnarray*}\\] That is, with \\(m\\) tests, rejecting any test whose p-value is less than or equal to \\(\\alpha/m\\) will control the FWER at \\(\\alpha\\). Alternatively, rejecting adjusted p-values less than \\(\\alpha\\) will also control the FWER at \\(\\alpha\\). Where the adjusted p-values are defined as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\tilde{p}_j = \\min(m p_j, 1) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Reject any hypothesis such that \\(\\tilde{p}_j \\leq \\alpha\\). Note that interpretations depend heavily on the number of tests (which is true about most multiple comparison adjustments). Bonferroni is extremely conservative, and therefore it has very high type II error rates (low power). We aren’t really interested in the situation where “all true null tests don’t get rejected.” 7.2.2 Holm Holm is a less conservative (than Bonferroni) method for controlling the FWER. Because each p-value is considered sequentially, the Holm adjustment is referred to as “step-up”. The intuition is that on the first step, the bound assumes up to \\(m\\) null hypotheses. But on the second step, there are only \\(m-1\\) null hypotheses (assuming the first p-value is rejected). To control the FWER at \\(\\alpha\\), first order the p-values as \\(p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq p_m\\) and define the adjusted p-values to be: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\tilde{p}_j = \\max_{i \\leq j} [ \\min((m-i+1) p_i, 1) ] \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Reject any hypothesis such that \\(\\tilde{p}_j \\leq \\alpha\\). FDR = \\(E[V/R]\\) The FDR (false discovery rate) is the expected proportion of false discoveries out of all the discoveries. PPV = \\(E[S/R]\\) Consider \\(m\\) hypotheses: Null True Alt True Research not significant \\(U\\) \\(T\\) \\(m-R\\) Finding significant \\(V\\) \\(S\\) \\(R\\) \\(m_0\\) \\(m-m_0\\) \\(m\\) 7.2.3 Benjamini-Hochberg When running experiments that have many many tests of significance, it is often more desirable to worry about the number of false discoveries as opposed to the probability of getting one false discovery. That is, we are typically comfortable with a few false positives (i.e., a very HIGH FWER) as long as the rate of false positives is low. Define the estimated false discovery proportion at a cutoff t (\\(\\hat{FDR}(t)\\)) to be the number of false discoveries at a given cutoff. Again, to control the FDR at \\(\\alpha\\), first order the p-values as \\(p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq p_m\\). \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{FDR}(t)&amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\# \\{ p_j \\leq t \\mbox{ out of the null tests } \\}}{ \\# \\{p_j \\leq t\\} + (1 \\mbox{ if all } p_j &gt; t)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Notice that p-values from null hypotheses will be distributed uniformly from zero to one. That means that a good estimate of the numerator is \\(t\\cdot\\) # of null tests. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{FDR}(p_j) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{p_j \\cdot m \\cdot \\pi_0}{j} &lt; \\frac{p_j m}{j} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\pi_0\\) is the proportion of tests which are truly null (\\(m_0/m\\)). Consider the adjusted p-values, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\tilde{p}_j = \\min [ (m/j) p_j, \\tilde{p}_{j+1} ] \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Reject any hypothesis such that \\(\\tilde{p}_j \\leq \\delta\\) to control the FDR at \\(\\delta\\). Intuition: let \\(m=1000\\), and suppose the \\(\\tilde{p}_{250} &lt; 0.4\\). Show that FDR \\(&lt; 0.4\\). \\(\\tilde{p}_{250} &lt; 0.4\\) implies two different things: \\(p_{250} \\leq \\frac{0.4\\cdot 250}{1000} = 0.1\\) and \\(\\approx 750\\) null tests have p-values between 0.1 and 1. If 750 null tests have p-values between 0.1 and 1, then \\(m_0 \\cdot 0.9 = 750 \\rightarrow m_0 = 833.33\\). Therefore, the number of null hypotheses which were rejected is 833.33 - 750 = 83.33. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} FDR = \\frac{83.33}{250} = 0.33 &lt; 0.4 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] More generally if \\(\\tilde{p}_k = \\frac{p_k \\cdot m}{k} \\leq \\delta\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} p_k &amp;&lt;&amp; \\frac{k}{m} \\delta\\\\ \\# \\mbox{ null not rejected} &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{length of null interval }\\bigg[\\frac{k}{m}\\delta,1\\bigg] \\cdot \\mbox{ total } \\# \\mbox{ of null}\\\\ (m-k) &amp;=&amp; \\bigg(1-\\frac{k}{m} \\delta\\bigg) m_0\\\\ m_0 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{(m-k) m}{(m-k \\delta)}\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ FDR &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\# \\mbox{ null rejected}}{\\# \\mbox{ rejected}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\frac{m(m-k)}{(m-k\\delta)} - (m-k)}{k}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{m^2 - mk - (m-k) (m-k \\delta)}{(m-k \\delta)k}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{k(m \\delta - k \\delta)}{k(m-k \\delta)} = \\delta\\bigg(\\frac{m-k}{m/\\delta - k}\\bigg)\\\\ FDR &amp;&lt;&amp; \\delta \\end{eqnarray*}\\] because \\(m/\\delta &gt; m\\) so \\(\\frac{m-k}{m/\\delta -k} &lt; 1\\). Consider a one sample t-test. The population is normal centered at 47 with \\(\\sigma=3\\); samples of size 20 are taken from the population. The following hypotheses are tested: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} H_0: \\mu = 47\\\\ H_{0_1}: \\mu = 40\\\\ H_{0_2}: \\mu = 48\\\\ H_{0_3}: \\mu = 50\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] In the null setting, the p-values are uniformly distributed from 0 to 1. When the data are not consistent with the null, there are more p-values close to zero (and even closer to zero as the data become more and more distinct from the null). 7.2.3.1 Distribution of p-values under different amounts of divergence from the null hypothesis. The previous example considered the situation where all the p-values came from the distribution. In reality, p-values will come from many different distributions. For simplification, consider the situation where g100% of the tests come from the null distribution, and (1-g)100% of the tests come from a distribution where the p-values are much closer to one and skewed right. 7.2.3.2 Distribution of p-values under differing proportions of null versus significant tests. 7.3 Storey &amp; q-values The previous methods allowed the larger family of tests to control either the FWER or the FDR (global measures of accuracy). However, for a given test, there was no measure to quantify FDR for a given test. p-value Recall that the p-value is the smallest level of significance (P(type I error)) possible to reject \\(H_0\\). q-value Akin to the p-value, the q-value is the minimum FDR at that score which can be attained when calling the test significant. Storey defines the q-value to be the FDR associated with a given test of significance. For example, say a q-value = 0.013 for test X. Then at most 1.3% of tests with p-values at least as small as test X are false positives. In particular, let \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\pi}_0 = \\frac{\\# \\{ p_j &gt; \\lambda \\} }{m(1-\\lambda)} \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ for some } \\lambda \\end{eqnarray*}\\] (though there are many ways to estimate \\(\\pi_0\\).) In a step-down algorithm, the q-value is defined using the p-value at hand and the next {} p-value. Additionally, the \\(\\pi_0\\) is implemented as seen in the original intuition behind FDR control. step 1 let \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{q}(p_{m}) = \\hat{\\pi}_0 p_{m} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that \\(\\hat{q}(p_{m})\\) is the biggest q-value and $ p_{m}$ is the biggest p-value. step 2 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{q}(p_{m-1}) = \\min( \\hat{\\pi}_0 p_{m-1} \\frac{m}{m-1}, \\hat{q}( p_{m})) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If \\(\\hat{q}(p_{m}) = 0.7\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_0 p_{m-1} \\frac{m}{m-1} = 0.8\\), then the next smallest q-value would be 0.7 because the FDR can be as low as 0.7 (see the definition of FDR). step 3 more generally, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{q}(p_{j}) = \\min( \\hat{\\pi}_0 p_{j} \\frac{m}{j}, \\hat{q}( p_{j+1})) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Can a q-value be less than a p-value? Sure! If the number of null hypotheses is small and the test is powerful. For example, consider testing 1000 hypotheses with 20% null tests (\\(\\pi_0=0.2\\)). Assume 500 of the p-values are less than 0.05 (very powerful!). With 200 null we would expect 10 to be less than 0.05. So, the FDR is 10/500 = 0.02 (which is smaller than the p-value of 0.05 at the cutoff for the \\(500^{th}\\) test). 7.3.0.1 How are FWER and FDR related? First note that for both FDR and FWER, the procedure is to control the errors not to compute or estimate the errors (except in the case of the q-value). Recall that \\(FDR = E[V/R]\\) and is defined to equal zero if R=0 \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} FDR &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} \\bigg]\\\\ &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0) + E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R=0 \\bigg] P(R=0)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] case 1 In the first case, consider \\(V=R\\) such that all significant hypotheses are null. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} FDR &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1 P(R&gt;0) = 1 P(V \\geq 1)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; FWER \\end{eqnarray*}\\] case 2 In the second case, consider \\(V &lt; R\\) such that some of the significant hypotheses are null and some are not. (\\(V/R &lt; 1\\)) \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} FDR &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0, V\\geq 1 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0, V \\geq 1) + E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0, V=0 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0, V =0)\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\mbox{ (note: } V/R \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ if } V = 0)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; E\\bigg[\\frac{V}{R} | R &gt; 0, V\\geq 1 \\bigg] P(R &gt;0, V \\geq 1) \\\\ &amp;&lt;&amp; P(V \\geq 1) = FWER \\ \\ \\mbox{ because } V/R &lt; 1 \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The proof above shows that FWER controls the FDR when not all significant tests are null. When all significant tests are null, FWER=FDR. 7.4 Interim Analyses An important application of multiple comparisons issues comes when deciding whether or not to stop a clinical trial early due to either positive or negative results. Looking too often will create many false positives which can be quite problematic. (Schulz and Grimes 2005) Consider the following case studies: HIV – Indinavir was stopped early due to positive results (Scott M. Hammer et al. 1997) HVTN 505 was stopped early due to negative results (Yunda Huang et al. 2015) Truvada &amp; Tenofovir were also stopped early (Dyer 2004) What happens when the research performs \\(k\\) interim analyses and the research scenario is truly null? \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P( test1 &lt; \\alpha \\mbox{ or } test2 &lt; \\alpha \\mbox{ or } \\ldots \\mbox{ or } testk &lt; \\alpha ) &gt; \\alpha \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The researcher has two options: Let \\(\\alpha^* &lt; &lt; &lt; \\alpha\\) Change \\(\\alpha\\) at each step along the way so that the total probability of a type I error is \\(\\alpha\\) Different \\(\\alpha^*\\) values for three different stopping criteria. Note that Peto does not control the test at an overall \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), although it is close. 7.4.1 Pocock Advantages: simple aggressive with respect to stopping early. that is, there is a small expected sample size (when the effect size is large) Disadvantage: low power and therefore large maximum sample size (when the effect size is small) 7.4.2 O’Brien-Flemming Advantages: final \\(\\alpha\\) is close to desired \\(\\alpha\\) more power than Pocock, so smaller max sample size Disadvantage: less likely to stop early, so larger expected sample size 7.4.3 Some parting thoughts If \\(H_a\\) is true, the effect size is likely overestimated (true in general, not just for interim analyses). Symmetry: which is more important, harm or good? Can split alpha into two halves and apply one method (e.g., Pocock) to stopping early for positive reasons and apply another method (e.g., O’Brien-Flemming) to stopping early for negative reasons. 7.4.3.1 Advice 1 The following quote is general advice from statistical researchers doing clinical oncology. (Green et al. 2016) Even the specifics of the most basic task of the data monitoring committee, evaluation of interim results for evidence of benefit or harm, are not necessarily obvious. Questions (and our personal answers) include: How often should the data monitoring committee review interim data? (The answer to this should depend on how fast additional information becomes available on a trial. we generally recommend monitoring advanced disease studies, or any other study with rapidly accumulating events, every 6 months. Yearly monitoring may be sufficient for adjuvant or slowly accruing studies.) Should the primary outcome data be reviewed each time or should they be reviewed only at times of planned interim analyses? (All data, including primary outcome data, should be reviewed at each time, since the unexpected does occur.) Should treatment arms be blinded to the data monitoring committee or not? (Definitely not. If A looks better than B, the decision to continue could well be different if A is the control arm instead of the experimental arm.) Should a data monitoring committee decision that evidence is sufficient to close a trail be final, or should it be advisory only? (We would say advisory, but rarely overturned.) If advisory, advisory to whom - the funding agency? an executive group? the investigators? (Reports should go to the individuals with ultimate responsibility for the integrity of the trial.) Should a data monitoring committee be able to make major design changes to a trial? (No, the data monitoring committee may offer suggestions but design is the responsibility of the principal investigators. On the other hand, major design changes initiated by the principal investigators should be approved by the committee.) Are data monitoring committee duties over when study accrual is complete, or should the data monitoring committee also decide when results are to be reported? (It should also decide when results are to be reported - additional follow-up generates additional data that still need to be monitored.) How much weight should be accorded to outside information versus current information on the study being monitored? (Definitive outside information cannot be ignored - but this begs the question of what is definitive. A single trial of moderate size probably is not definitive; two large trials probably are; a meta-analysis probably is not.) How much should results of secondary endpoints influence the decision to continue or not? (Not much unless toxic death is considered secondary.) How scary do results have to be to stop at a time other than a planned interim analysis? (Very scary, or the purpose of interim analyses is defeated.) When do accrual problems justify early closure? (When results won’t be available until after they are no longer of interest.) Should confidential information ever be provided to other data monitoring committees or planning groups? (Sometimes. If study conduct will not be compromised by limited release of information, it might be reasonable to let investigators planning new trials know of potential problems or benefits to treatment arms they are considering. Risk to the ongoing trial includes leaked information or intelligent guesses as to the current status; risk to the new trial includes choosing an inappropriate arm based on early results that don’t hold up.) Every monitoring committee functions differently because no two people have the same ethical, scientific, or practical perspectives. This means different committees might well come up with different answers to the same monitoring issues. To ensure some balance of opinions, it is best to have a variety of knowledgeable people as members of the committee. 7.4.3.2 Advice 2 Duncan Temple-Lang is a leader in the area of combining computer science research concepts within the context of statistics and science more generally. Recently, he was invited to participate in a workshop, Training Students to Extract Value from Big Data. The workshop was subsequently summarized in a manuscript of the same name and has been provided free of charge. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18981 Principles for the Data Science Process, Duncan Temple Lang, University of California, Davis (National Research Council: Training Students to Extract Value from Big Data 2014) Duncan Temple Lang began by listing the core concepts of data science - items that will need to be taught: statistics and machine learning, computing and technologies, and domain knowledge of each problem. He stressed the importance of interpretation and reasoning - not only methods - in addressing data. Students who work in data science will have to have a broad set of skills - including knowledge of randomness and uncertainty, statistical methods, programming, and technology - and practical experience in them. Students tend to have had few computing and statistics classes on entering graduate school in a domain science. Temple Lang then described the data analysis pipeline, outlining the steps in one example of a data analysis and exploration process: Asking a general question. Refining the question, identifying data, and understanding data and metadata. Temple Lang noted that the data used are usually not collected for the specific question at hand, so the original experiment and data set should be understood. Access to data. This is unrelated to the science but does require computational skill. Transforming to data structures. Exploratory data analyses to understand the data and determine whether the results will scale. This is a critical step; Temple Lang noted that 80 percent of a data scientist’s time can be spent in cleaning and preparing the data. Dimension reduction. Temple Lang stressed that it can be difficult or impossible to automate this step. Modeling and estimation. Temple Lang noted that computer and machine learning scientists tend to focus more on predictive models than on modeling of physical behavior or characteristics. Diagnostics. This helps to understand how well the model fits the data and identifies anomalies and aspects for further study. This step has similarities to exploratory data analysis. Quantifying uncertainty. Temple Lang indicated that quantifying uncertainty with statistical techniques is important for understanding and interpreting models and results. Conveying results. Temple Lang stressed that the data analysis process is highly interactive and iterative and requires the presence of a human in the loop. The next step in data processing is often not clear until the results of the current step are clear, and often something unexpected is uncovered. He also emphasized the importance of abstract skills and concepts and said that people need to be exposed to authentic data analyses, not only to the methods used. Data scientists also need to have a statistical understanding, and Temple Lang described the statistical concepts that should be taught to a student: Mapping the general question to a statistical framework. Understanding the scope of inference, sampling, biases, and limitations. Exploratory data analyses, including missing values, data quality, cleaning, matching, and fusing. Understanding randomness, variability, and uncertainty. Temple Lang noted that many students do not understand sampling variability. Conditional dependence and heterogeneity. Dimension reduction, variable selection, and sparsity. Spurious relationships and multiple testing. Parameter estimation versus “black box” prediction and classification. Diagnostics, residuals, and comparing models. Quantifying the uncertainty of a model. Sampling structure and dependence for data reduction. Temple Lang noted that modeling of data becomes complicated when variables are not independent, identically distributed. Statistical accuracy versus computational complexity and efficiency. Temple Lang then briefly discussed some of the practical aspects of computing, including the following: Accessing data. Manipulating raw data. Data structures and storage, including correlated data. Visualization at all stages (particularly in exploratory data analyses and conveying the results). Parallel computing, which can be challenging for a new student. Translating high-level descriptions to optimal programs. During the discussion, Temple Lang proposed computing statistics on visualizations to examine data rigorously in a statistical and automated way. He explained that “scagnostics” (from scatter plot diagnostics) is a data analysis technique for graphically exploring the relationships among variables. A small set of statistical measures can characterize scatter plots, and exploratory data analysis can be conducted on the residuals. (More information about scagnostics can be found in Wilkinson and Wills (2007).) A workshop participant noted the difference between a data error and a data blunder. A blunder is a large, easily noticeable mistake. The participant gave the example of shipboard observations of cloud cover; blunders, in that case, occur when the location of the ship observation is given to be on land rather than at sea. Another blunder would be a case of a ship’s changing location too quickly. The participant speculated that such blunders could be generalized to detect problematic observations, although the tools would need to be scalable to be applied to large data sets. References "],

Indeed, the example above acts as a proxy for many regression examples where the response variable is a count with particular properties: The response variable is a count (in particular, it cannot be negative). The model may or may not be linear in X. The model appears to have increasing variance as a function of X. For the setting above, it is often preferable to use Poisson regression instead of the normal errors linear regression. 8.1.1 The Poisson Regression Model The Poisson distribution is given by a probability function of the form: \\[P(Y = y) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu^y}{y!} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ y=0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\] Which gives: \\(E(Y) = \\mu\\) and \\(Var(Y) = \\mu\\). That is, the Poisson model is characterized by a mean and variance given by the same value. Recall that with linear regression, \\(E(Y_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\\) which might be a reasonable idea to apply to the count data; however, as seen above, if the mean of the distribution is modeled strictly as a linear function in \\(X\\), then the line has the potential to predict negative counts and the variability will not be a function of \\(X\\) if normal errors regression is used. An alternative the normal errors regression is to use a \\(\\ln\\) transformation to describe the relationship between the predicted value of the response and the explanatory variables of interest: \\[\\ln(E(Y_i)) = \\ln(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i.\\] where the observed counts come from a Poisson model: \\(Y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i)\\) and the Poisson parameter is given as a function of the explanatory variable(s). [Note that Poisson regression contains no error term like linear regression because the Poisson distribution has inherent variability which is determined by the mean which equals the variance.] 8.1.1.1 Technical Conditions Like every model, there are technical conditions associated with Poisson Regression. The closer the data (population) conform to the conditions, the more useful the model will be at describing the context at hand. Remember, &gt; All models are wrong, but some models are useful.&quot; -George Box. So, assessing whether the technical conditions are reasonable will help in determining whether the analysis performed under a particular model was a good thing to do. Line: The log of the mean is a linear function of \\(X\\): \\(\\ln(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i.\\) Independence: The observations are independent (often characterized by a simple random sample or something approximating a simple random sample). Poisson: The response variable is a count. Error: The mean of the response variables is equal to the variance of the response variable for each combination of explanatory variables in the model. Visualizing Normal vs Poisson Error Regression from Legler and Roback (2019) 8.1.2 Comparison to Linear Regression One question that might come to mind is whether there is any difference in the Poisson log-linear model and a normal errors regression model with a log transformation on the response??? The short answer is that yes, there is a difference. Poisson Log-Linear: \\(\\ln(E(Y_i)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i, Y_i \\sim Pois(e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i})\\) Normal w Log Transformation: \\(E(\\ln(Y_i)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i, \\ln(Y_i) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i, \\sigma^2)\\) There are two main differences with the models. The first is to remember that the average (i.e., expected value) of the logs is not the log of the averages. So in the Poisson model, the linear function measures the log of the average, and in the normal model, the linear function measures the average of the logs. set.seed(47) example &lt;- abs(rcauchy(10)) example ## [1] 0.07250266 2.39114995 0.93022166 0.62369321 4.25084018 ## [6] 1.45750156 2.75212953 10.21765703 7.30420453 0.24043747 log(mean(example)) ## [1] 1.106592 mean(log(example)) ## [1] 0.3426701 The second difference to note across the two regression set-ups is that the variability is modeled differently. Indeed, the likelihood functions are quite different and will produce different maximum likelihood estimates of the parameter values. Differences in Normal vs Poisson Error Regression from Legler and Roback (2019) 8.1.3 Interpreting Poisson Regression Coefficients As we’ve done with other generalized linear models (linear regression, logistic regression, even survival analysis!), in order to understand the model more completely, we look at the impact on the response variable for a one unit change in \\(X\\). Consider \\(X\\) and \\(X+1\\). \\[\\frac{E(Y|X+1)}{E(Y|X)} = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (X+1)}}{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (X)}} = e^{\\beta_1}\\] That is, \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) represents the ratio of means for a one unit increase in \\(X\\). In the elephant example, for every additional year of life, we expect the elephant’s mating success, on average, to change by a factor of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). [For the savvy consumer, you might note that this is an additional contrast to normal error regression on the log transformed Y where it was required to interpret the multiplicative change in median. Because with Poisson, the log is taken after the average, taking the inverse of the log gives the mean directly. Previously, it was necessary to use the identity: \\(median(\\ln(Y)) = \\ln(median(Y))\\).] 8.1.4 Assessing Model Validity Just as with linear regression we used scatterplots to give a sense of whether or not a linear regression was appropriate, we can use exploratory data analysis (including scatterplot!) to give a sense of whether or not Poisson regression is an appropriate model. (The EDA steps here are based on excellent descriptions of Poisson model building in Legler and Roback 2019.) Technical Condition 3, Poisson: Let’s first look at the response variable. A histogram of the number of successful matings shows a right skew which is typically not acceptable for normal errors regression (although, remember, the value of the response variable is dependent on the value of the explanatory variable!) Likely, it makes more sense to look at the distribution of the response variable at each value of the explanatory variables. Because the sample size is limited, we group the age variable into 5 year increments. Looking at the plot below, again it seems as though, even when conditioning on the explanatory variable, the response is right skewed with variance dependent on the mean. It might also be good to find the sample mean per group and plot the Poisson probabilities onto each bar. Technical Condition 4, Error: To check whether the mean and variance are similar, we can calculate the values per group (with more data we would probably have more groups of the explanatory variable, and the following analysis would be done with a scatterplot of means on the x-axis and variance on the y-axis). Note that the mean and variance are reasonably similar! When the “mean=variance” condition is violated, it is almost always violated in such that the variance is even bigger than would have been expected by the Poisson model. Large variance is called overdispersion, and methods for measuring and accounting for overdispersion are given in the following section 8.2.1.2. ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## AGEgroups mean variance stdev n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 (20,30] 1.08 0.992 0.996 12 ## 2 (30,40] 2.71 2.85 1.69 17 ## 3 (40,55] 4.25 7.84 2.80 12 Technical Condition 1, Line: The Poisson model implies that the log of the mean will be a linear function of the explanatory variable: \\[\\ln(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i,\\] which means we’d really like to plot \\(\\mu_i\\) as a function of the explanatory variable. Unfortunately, \\(\\mu_i\\) is unknown, and so cannot be plotted. We can, however, plot the log of the average value of the response for a group of x values which are close to one another. In the plot below, we’ve grouped observations based on the age of the elephants being within 3 years of years of each other. It is actually quite linear! The points that don’t follow the linear relationship are based on age groups with very few observations. matelogmean &lt;- elephants %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(agecut = cut(AGE, breaks=seq(26.5,53.5,by=3))) %&gt;% group_by(agecut) %&gt;% summarize(meanmate = mean(MATINGS), logmate = log(mean(MATINGS)), n = n() ) elephantsGRP &lt;- cbind(matelogmean, age = c(seq(26.5,52.5,by=3)+1.5 )) elephantsGRP ## agecut meanmate logmate n age ## 1 (26.5,29.5] 1.090909 0.08701138 11 28 ## 2 (29.5,32.5] 1.500000 0.40546511 2 31 ## 3 (32.5,35.5] 2.444444 0.89381788 9 34 ## 4 (35.5,38.5] 3.500000 1.25276297 6 37 ## 5 (38.5,41.5] 2.000000 0.69314718 2 40 ## 6 (41.5,44.5] 3.571429 1.27296568 7 43 ## 7 (44.5,47.5] 6.000000 1.79175947 2 46 ## 8 (47.5,50.5] 2.000000 0.69314718 1 49 ## 9 (50.5,53.5] 9.000000 2.19722458 1 52 elephantsGRP %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=age, y=logmate)) + geom_point() 8.2 Inference in Poisson Regression Recall that in Poisson regression, \\(E(Y_i) = \\mu_i = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}\\). Therefore, the probability function for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is: \\[f(y_i) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu_i} \\mu_i^{y_i}}{y_i!} = \\frac{e^{-e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}} \\bigg(e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}\\bigg)^{y_i}}{y_i!}.\\] Which gives the resulting likelihood of: \\[L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{e^{-\\mu_i} \\mu_i^{y_i}}{y_i!} = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{e^{-e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}} \\bigg(e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i}\\bigg)^{y_i}}{y_i!}.\\] And the log likelihood becomes: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} l(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) &amp;=&amp; \\ln L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\bigg(-\\mu_i + y_i \\ln(\\mu_i) - \\ln(y_i!) \\bigg) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\bigg(-e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i} + y_i (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i) - \\ln(y_i!) \\bigg). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 8.2.1 Maximum Likelihood As with other probabilistic models we’ve encountered, the joint likelihood of the entire sample represents the product of the individual likelihoods for each data value. The likelihood (or more typically, the \\(\\ln\\)-likelihood) is maximized to find estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). The parameter estimates maximize the \\(\\ln\\)-likelihood, and the SE of the estimates are given by the Fisher Information from the likelihood (roughly the second derivative). Given \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) as estimates of the parameter values, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), we can estimate the average count value: \\[\\hat{\\mu}_i = e^{b_0 + b_1 X_i}\\] 8.2.1.1 Residuals Note that we expect the residuals of a Poisson model to have larger variability for larger values of the prediction. That makes interpreting the residuals slightly different that previously for a linear regression model. Pearson residual: \\[res_{pi} = \\frac{y_i - \\hat{\\mu}_i}{\\hat{\\mu}_i}\\] Deviance residual: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} res_{di} &amp;=&amp; [-\\hat{\\mu}_i + y_i \\ln(\\hat{\\mu}_i) - \\ln(y_i!) ] - [-y_i + y_i \\ln(y_i) - \\ln(y_i!) ] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; y_i-\\hat{\\mu}_i + y_i \\ln\\bigg(\\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_i}{y_i}\\bigg) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Along with giving information about individual residual values, the sum of the Deviance residuals is also a way to test for goodness-of-fit of the model. Given the null hypothesis that the Poisson is the appropriate model, the test of goodness-of-fit for the Poisson model is given by: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n res_{di} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\chi_{n-p}^2.\\] 8.2.1.2 Dealing with Overdispersion A probability structure that is given by a variance which is larger than the mean, may end up with: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} E(Y_i) &amp;=&amp; \\mu_i\\\\ Var(Y_i) &amp;=&amp; \\phi \\mu_i\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] If we can estimate \\(\\phi\\), then a more appropriate SE to use is adjusted by \\(\\phi\\): \\(SE_Q(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{\\phi} SE(\\hat{\\beta})\\). (\\(Q\\) stands for “quasiPoisson”.) When \\(Y\\) comes from a setting where the sample size is large, then we can use normal (sums of standard normal random variables are distributed according to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution) theory to assess the residuals: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n res_{pi}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(Y_i - \\mu_i)^2}{Var(Y_i)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(Y_i - \\mu_i)^2}{\\phi \\mu_i} \\sim \\chi^2_{n-p}\\] The expected value of \\(\\chi^2_{n-p}\\) is \\(n-p\\), which gives an estimator of \\(\\phi\\) to be: \\[\\hat{\\phi} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(Y_i - \\mu_i)^2}{\\mu_i} /(n-p).\\] Note that your text uses the Deviance residual instead of the Pearson residual to estimate \\(\\phi\\). Both are reasonable things to do. 8.2.2 Wald Tests As before, Wald tests are given by standardizing the coefficients and finding p-values using normal theory: \\[\\frac{b_i - 0}{SE(b_i)} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} N(0,1).\\] If overdispersion is expected, then the SE is adjusted and the t-distribution is used for calculating p-values: \\[\\frac{b_i - 0}{SE_Q(b_i)} = \\frac{b_i - 0}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\phi}} SE(b_i)} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-p}.\\] 8.2.3 Drop-in-Deviance Tests The deviance for a Poisson is reasonably straightforward and comes directly from the likelihood, it is twice the sum of the deviance residuals: \\[D = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n [Y_i \\ln(Y_i / \\hat{\\mu_i}) - (Y_i - \\hat{\\mu_i})].\\] For two nested models (that is, the smaller one is obtained by forcing some of the coefficients in the larger model to be zero), a drop-in-deviance test can be calculated using: \\[D_{reduced} - D_{full} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\chi^2_{d}\\] where \\(d\\) is the difference in the number of parameters estimated in the two models. The drop-in-deviance test can also be adjusted for overdispersion: \\(F_Q = (D_{reduced} - D_{full}) / \\hat{\\phi} \\sim F_{d, n-p}\\) where \\(d\\) is the difference in the number of parameters estimated in the two models, and \\(p\\) is the total number of parameters estimated in the full model. 8.3 R Poisson Example The R example is taken from data given in the textbook. The scientific question relates to predicting the total number of observed species on the Galapagos archipelago related to island area (km\\(^2\\)), elevation (m), distance (km) to the nearest neighbor and to the largest island (km\\(^2\\)) in the archipelago Santa Cruz (scruz), and the area of the adjacent island (km\\(^2\\)). We could also consider an additional response variable which is the island endemic species count. galap &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;Galapagos.csv&quot;) head(galap) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## island species endemics area elevation nearest scruz adjacent ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Baltra 58 23 25.1 346 0.6 0.6 1.84 ## 2 Bartolome 31 21 1.24 109 0.6 26.3 572. ## 3 Caldwell 3 3 0.21 114 2.8 58.7 0.78 ## 4 Champion 25 9 0.1 46 1.9 47.4 0.18 ## 5 Coamano 2 1 0.05 77 1.9 1.9 904. ## 6 DaphneMajor 18 11 0.34 119 8 8 1.84 ggplot(galap, aes(y=species, x = log(area), color = adjacent)) + geom_point() 8.3.1 glm glm(species ~ log(area) + log(elevation) + nearest + scruz + adjacent, data= galap, family=&quot;poisson&quot;) %&gt;% tidy() ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 3.02 0.303 9.96 2.28e-23 ## 2 log(area) 0.315 0.0185 17.1 2.20e-65 ## 3 log(elevation) 0.0977 0.0604 1.62 1.06e- 1 ## 4 nearest -0.00106 0.00169 -0.626 5.32e- 1 ## 5 scruz -0.00314 0.000597 -5.26 1.40e- 7 ## 6 adjacent -0.000243 0.0000281 -8.65 5.31e-18 8.3.2 drop in deviance It seems like we might not need either log(elevation) or nearest.

The broom package provides .residuals which are the observed value minus the fitted value.
