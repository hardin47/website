## Course Goals

Our goals in this course are: 

* to better evaluate quantitative information with regards to clinical and biological data. We'll be sure to keep in mind:
    * Careful presentation of data  
    * Consideration of variability  
    * Meaningful comparisons  

* to be able to critically evaluate the medical literature with respect to design, analysis, and interpretation of results.  
* to understand the role of inherent variability and keep it in perspective when inferring results to a population.  
* to critically evaluate medical results given in the mainstream media.  
* to read published studies with skepticism.  Some people (in all fields!) wrongly believe that all studies published in a peer review publication must be 100% accurate and/or well designed studies.  In this course, you will learn the tools to recognize, interpret, and critique statistical results in medical literature.

### Experimental Design {-}
In this class we'll talk about techniques used to analyze data from medical studies.  Along with the computational methods, however, we'll continue to think about issues of experimental design and interpretation.

**Descriptive statistics** describe the sample at hand with no intent on making generalizations.  
**Inferential statistics** use a sample to make claims about a population  
**Simple Random Sample** is an unbiased sample.  Sample is selected in such a way that every possible sample of size $n$ is equally likely.  
**Blind / double blind** when the patient and/or doctor do not know which patient is receiving which treatment.  
**Placebo** mock treatment  
**Sample size** reduces variability (large samples make small effects easier to discern)  
**Experiment vs. Observational Study** whether the treatment was assigned by the researchers; randomized experiments make concluding causation possible  
**Funding of study** goals, bias
