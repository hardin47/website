**SQL** code is written as a series of **statements**. @sec-create-db and @sec-change-db will cover statements like `CREATE` for defining new tables and `INSERT` for adding data.  @sec-sql-clauses covers `SELECT` statements, which are arguably the most useful statements for data scientists.  `SELECT` statements are also called queries because they query table(s), with particular characteristics, from databases.

A query is made up of **clauses**. Every query must have a `SELECT` and `FROM` clause.  Other clauses include `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`, all of which will be covered in @sec-sql-clauses.
