# Using SQL {#sec-using-sql .unnumbered}


**SQL** code is written as a series of **statements**. Later in the text, @sec-create-db and @sec-change-db cover statements like `CREATE` for defining new tables and `INSERT` for adding data. In this part, @sec-sql-clauses covers `SELECT` statements, which are arguably the most useful statements for data scientists.  `SELECT` statements are also called queries because they query table(s), with particular characteristics, from databases.

A query is made up of **clauses**. Every query must have a `SELECT` and `FROM` clause.  Other clauses include `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`, all of which will be covered in @sec-sql-clauses.

Because of the efficiency of data storage in **SQL** databases, it is often necessary to combine information held across two or more tables.  @sec-join covers combining tables via `JOIN` (combining columns) and via `UNION` (combining rows).
