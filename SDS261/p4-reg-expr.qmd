# Regular expressions {#sec-reg-expr .unnumbered}

Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define search patterns.  Symbolic notation is used to find particular sequences of interest.  Regular expressions are used in many different contexts including **SQL** queries, web scraping, and data wrangling. @sec-reg-expr covers regular expressions within R, but the syntax for pattern matching is identical across almost all platforms and programming languages.
