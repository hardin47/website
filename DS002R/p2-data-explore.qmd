<!--
Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define search patterns.  Symbolic notation is used to find particular sequences of interest.  Regular expressions are used in many different contexts including **SQL** queries, web scraping, and data wrangling. @sec-reg-expr covers regular expressions within **R**, but the syntax for pattern matching is identical across almost all platforms and programming languages.  One thing to note is that to escape a metacharacter in **R**, two backslashes are needed.  For example, `\\d` is the correct syntax to denote a digit.
