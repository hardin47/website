# Building databases {#sec-build-db .unnumbered}

Along with querying and combining tables in **SQL**, building a **SQL** database takes care. In order to practice building a **SQL** database, we will work with <a href = "https://duckdb.org/" target = "_blank">DuckDB</a>.  **DuckDB** is a platform that creates a local server (on your own computer) and uses syntax which is slightly different from **MySQL**.

In @sec-create-db we walk through creating a database using **DuckDB**.  We note that some of the syntax is identical to **MySQL** and other syntax is different.  Keys, indices, and partitioning help optimize the database for  efficient querying.

With an existing database, @sec-change-db walks through how to `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `REPLACE` data.  Additionally, temporary tables are used to break down complicated queries into shorter more succinct queries.
