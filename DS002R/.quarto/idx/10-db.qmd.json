However, before we jump into learning the power of **SQL**, we will start with two preliminary lessons:\n\n1. understanding what is a database and why would we ever want to use a database. See @sec-what-db.\n2. using the **R** package **dbplyr** which translates **dplyr** code into **SQL**.  Recall the data wrangling with which you are already familiar, including `filter()`, `select()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `arrange()`, all of which live in **dplyr**. See @sec-dplyr-seq.\n\n\n## What is a database? {#sec-what-db}\n\nA database is a structured collection of data that is organized in such a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.  They are particularly important for industries with exceptionally large amounts of data which can be partitioned into different tables.  Additionally, databases allow for multiple users to access the data simultaneously.\n\nYou are likely already familiar with the concept of *tidy* data. (If you have never encountered tidy data, see <a href = \"https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy\" target = \"_blank\">Chapter 5 Data tidying</a> in **R for Data Science**.) Tidy data typically live in data frames or **tables**; where, importantly, they consist of columns of variables (where every column is the same type!) and the rows of observational units.\n\nConceptually, a table in a database is no different from the data frames which are used in **R**. They will always be rectangles with the same row and column structure.\n\nThere are two big differences between a stand alone data frame (e.g., in **R**) and a table which lives in a database (e.g., in **SQL**).\n\n1. Most importantly, tables in databases can be arbitrarily large, primarily due to being stored on disk.  Indeed, they are typically not stored on **your** computer's disk, they are stored remotely on a hard drive outside of your own computer and work space.  Data frames are stored in memory (on your computer) and can be quite limited in size.\n\n   * Memory (RAM) is the amount of data that a computer can work on simultaneously.  My computer has 32 GB of RAM.  The important thing about memory is that the computer has easy access to its own memory and will access it quickly (tens of GBs per second).\n\n   * Hard Disk is the amount of data that a computer can store permanently; it is your storage space. My computer has 2 TB of storage.  Accessing the disk is much slower (hundreds of MBs per second) than accessing the memory.  Accessing disk space is even slower if the storage lives on a different computer and is accessed virtually (via WiFi).  \n\n2. The tables in a database are usually linked with a **key**.  We will cover `join()` functions in @sec-join, but keep in mind that in order to get information from one table to connect to information in another table, we need to somehow relate the rows of the first table to the rows of the second table.\n\n## The `airlines` database\n\nTo demonstrate the difference between data frames in memory and tables in storage, we will consider the `airlines` data consisting of millions of individual flights between 2010 and 2017. The flights are downloaded from the <a href = \"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Homepage.asp\" target = \"_blank\">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>, US Department of Transportation. The database is a superset of the `nycflights13` R package that tracks only flights in and out of airports serving New York City in 2013.\n\nThe full data set occupies almost 20GB when they are saved as CSV (comma separated value) files, a common way to hold data that can be represented as columns of text which are separated by commas. \n\n\n## Tables in **SQL**\n\nTo look at the **airlines** data tables, we first need to connect to the database remotely.  The function `dbConnect_scidb()` in the **mdsr** package allows us to connect to the databases which are stored for use with the text **Modern Data Science with R**.\n\nThe `tbl()` function (in the **dplyr** package) maps the tables called `flights` and `carriers` from the database to an object in **R**.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mdsr)\ncon_air <- mdsr::dbConnect_scidb(\"airlines\")\nflights <- tbl(con_air, \"flights\")\ncarriers <- tbl(con_air, \"carriers\")\n```\n\n\nAlternatively, the **SQL** connection can be set up directly using information specific to the **mdsr** **R** package database.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\ncon_air <- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname = \"airlines\",\n  host = Sys.getenv(\"MDSR_HOST\"),\n  user = Sys.getenv(\"MDSR_USER\"),\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"MDSR_PWD\")\n)\n```\n\n\nWe can now use the objects `flights` and `carriers` as if they were data frames, but they are not actually the **R** version of `data.frame`.  Instead, they exist as a `tbl` which is a special object that behaves similarly to a `data.frame`.\n\nThe `carriers` data represents the name of each airline and the associated carrier code.  Note that when the data are printed to screen, the number of rows is given by `??`, indicating that they are unknown. Indeed, **R** just needed the first few rows to print to screen, no need to spend precious computing resources looking at the entire table.\n\n```{r}\ncarriers \n```\n\n\nWith the `carriers` data, it is possible, however, to load the entire object into **R** using `collect()`. Now, when the data are printed to screen, the object is a `tibble` and **R** knows that it has 1,610 rows.\n\n```{r}\ncarriers |>\n  collect() \n```\n\n\nAs already mentioned, working in **R** versus working remotely has trade-offs. Remember that the object takes up much more space in your memory if you load it into **R**.  Consider the following which demonstrates how much more memory intensive it is to hold an object in **R**.\n\n```{r}\n# carriers lives in the SQL database and is linked remotely\ncarriers |>\n  object.size() |>\n  print(units = \"Kb\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n# carriers lives in R\ncarriers |>\n  collect() |>\n  object.size() |>\n  print(units = \"Kb\")\n```\n\n\nIndeed, the `flights` data set contains all of the flights and is much larger than the `carriers` data set.  When pulled into **R** it takes up almost 5 GB of memory (!), but when it exists as only a connection to the **SQL** database is uses just a few Kb of memory.\n\n```{r}\n# flights lives in the database and is linked remotely\nflights |>\n  object.size() |>\n  print(units = \"Kb\")\n```\n\nAlways a good idea to terminate the **SQL** connection when you are done with it.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(DBI)\ndbDisconnect(con_air, shutdown = TRUE)\n```\n\n## Engaging with a database\n\n### Many **SQL** implementations\n\n<a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\" target = \"_blank\">**SQL** (Structured Query Language)</a> is a query language for working with relational databases.  (The relational part means that the data sets are connected in a meaningful way, the database part means that we have lots of tables living somewhere remotely on a hard drive.)  **SQL** has been around since the 1970s and is extremely powerful for data wrangling tasks.  \n\nAlthough **SQL** has been a standard for the <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute\" target = \"_blank\">American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</a> since 1986, there <a href = \"https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/15-sqlI.html#the-sql-universe\" target = \"_blank\">exist many dialects</a> of **SQL**. Translating between the dialects is not always easy although once you learn how to program in one dialect, you will be able to pick up any of the other **SQL** dialects.  We will use <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\" target = \"_blank\">MySQL</a> in this class. MySQL is among the most popular implementations of **SQL** and it is open source.\n\n\n### **SQL** interfaces\n\n**MySQL** is based on a client-server model. The data live on a powerful computer (the server) and you connect to the data from your own computer (the client).  In this class:\n\n* **SQL** code will be written in the **MySQL** dialect\n* using both <a href = \"https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/\" target = \"_blank\">RStudio</a> and <a href = \"https://dbeaver.io/\" target= \"_blank\">DBeaver</a> as the interface to\n* connect to many different remote servers.\n\n### **SQL** in-process\n\nAnother approach to engaging with **SQL** is where the client and the server are both on a single computer (called in-process).  You may want to set up a database on your own computer to try things out and avoid monthly charges associated with buying server space in the cloud.  Indeed, for the end of the semester project, if you choose to set up a database on your own computer, a good free database management system is <a href = \"https://duckdb.org/\" target = \"_blank\">Duckdb</a>\n\n\n## Connecting to a database\n\nWhen using **R** to connect to a database, we need two **R** packages. **DBI** is a low-level interface that connects to databases and executes **SQL**; **RMariaDB** is a package specifically tailored for **MySQL** which translates generic **DBI** commands into the specific syntax needed for **MySQL**.\n\nA third **R** package, **dbplyr**, is a high-level interface that translates dplyr code (i.e., **R** code) to **SQL** queries then executes them with DBI.  \n\n### Creating a database connection\n\nBefore we can do anything, we need to set up a connection to a **MySQL** database.  We will call the connection `con`, and the syntax will look something like what is written below.  However, the code below won't run because values must be set for `dbname`, `host`, `user`, and `password`.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\ncon <- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname = \"  \",\n  host = \"  \",\n  user = \"  \",\n  password = \"  \"\n)\n```\n\n\nNote that the function `dbConnect_scidb()` in the **mdsr** package is just a wrapper of the `dbConnect()` function where all the arguments are filled in to connect to the **mdsr** database.\n\nAlways a good idea to terminate the **SQL** connection when you are done with it.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\ndbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n### Connecting to Duckdb\n\nConnecting to Duckdb is reasonably straightforward because the default values of the `duckdb()` function in the **duckdb** package create a temporary database that is deleted when you quit **R**.\n\n```{r}\ncon_duckdb <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n```\n\n\nAlways a good idea to terminate the **SQL** connection when you are done with it.\n\n```{r}\ndbDisconnect(con_duckdb, shutdown = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i> Reflection questions  \n\n1. Why is **SQL** such an important tool for data scientists?  That is, what are the characteristics that make it useful?\n\n2. What is a relational database?\n\n3. (Maybe best to answer after learning a few more concepts.)  What are the main differences between working with a data frame in **R** and a table in **SQL**?\n\n4. How does one connect to a SQL database?  Using R? Using DuckDB?\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-balance-scale\"></i> Ethics considerations \n\n1. Why should you need a password to access a **SQL** server?\n\n2. What other skills for working with databases are important, beyond accessing, wrangling, and creating databases?  (E.g., provenance of the data, purpose of the data's use, protection of data, privacy of data... etc.  Why / how are those important?)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":6,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"fig-show":"hold","fig-align":"center","callout-icon":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-in-header":["js/mathjax-popover.html"],"output-file":"10-db.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
