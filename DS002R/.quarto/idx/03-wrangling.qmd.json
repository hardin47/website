The approach taken in the following chapter is based on the philosophy of tidy data and takes many of its precepts from database theory.  If you have done much work in SQL, the functionality and approach of tidy data will feel very familiar.  The more adept you are at data wrangling, the more effective you will be at data analysis.\n\n\n```{r, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, \n                      fig.height=3, fig.width=5,  \n                      cache=TRUE, fig.align = \"center\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n\n>Information is what we want, but data are what we've got. [@Kaplan15]\n\n**Embrace all the ways to get help!**\n\n1. cheat sheets: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/\n2. tidyverse vignettes: https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/\n3. pivoting: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html\n4. google what you need and include `R tidy` or `tidyverse`\n\n## Structure of Data {#datastruc}\n\nFor plotting, analyses, model building, etc., it's important that the data be structured in a very particular way.   Hadley Wickham provides a thorough discussion and advice for cleaning up the data in @Wickham14.\n\n* *Tidy Data*: rows (cases/observational units) and columns (variables).  The key is that *every* row is a case and *every} column is a variable.  No exceptions.\n* Creating tidy data is not trivial.  We work with objects (often data tables), functions, and arguments (often variables).\n\n\nThe Active Duty data are not tidy!  What are the cases?  How are the data not tidy?  What might the data look like in tidy form?  Suppose that the case was \"an individual in the armed forces.\"  What variables would you use to capture the information in the following table?\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ow6Cm4z-Z1Yybk3i352msulYCEDOUaOghmo9ALajyHo/edit#gid=1811988794\n\n![](images/activedutyTidy.png)\n\n**Problem:** totals and different sheets\n\n**Better for R:** longer format with columns - grade, gender, status, service, count (case is still the total pay grade)\n\n**Case is individual (?)**:  grade, gender, status, service (no count because each row does the counting)\n\n### Building Tidy Data\n\nWithin R (really within any type of computing language, Python, SQL, Java, etc.), we need to understand how to build data using the patterns of the language.  Some things to consider:\n\n\n* `object_name = function_name(arguments)` is a way of using a function to create a new object.\n* `object_name = data_table %>% function_name(arguments)` uses chaining syntax as an extension of the ideas of functions.  In chaining, the value on the left side of `%>%` becomes the *first argument* to the function on the right side.\n\n\n``` \nobject_name = data_table %>%\nfunction_name(arguments) %>% \nfunction_name(arguments)\n```\nis extended chaining.  `%>%` is never at the front of the line, it is always connecting one idea with the continuation of that idea on the next line.\n* In R, all functions take arguments in round parentheses (as opposed to subsetting observations or variables from data objects which happen with square parentheses).  Additionally, the spot to the left of `%>%` is always a data table.\n* The pipe syntax should be read as *then*, `%>%`.\n\n### Examples of Chaining\n\nThe pipe syntax (`%>%`) takes a data frame (or data table) and sends it to the argument of a function.  The mapping goes to the first available argument in the function.  For example:\n\n`x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`\n\n` y %>% f(x, ., z)` is the same as `f(x,y,z)`\n\n#### Little Bunny Foo Foo\n\nFrom Hadley Wickham, how to think about tidy data.\n\n> Little bunny Foo Foo\n> Went hopping through the forest\n> Scooping up the field mice\n> And bopping them on the head\n\nThe nursery rhyme could be created by a series of steps where the output from each step is saved as an object along the way.\n\n```\nfoo_foo <- little_bunny()\nfoo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)\nfoo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_2, up = field_mice)\nfoo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)\n```\n\nAnother approach is to concatenate the functions so that there is only one output.  \n\n```\nbop(\n   scoop(\n      hop(foo_foo, through = forest),\n      up = field_mice),\n   on = head)\n```\n\nOr even worse, as one line:\n\n```\nbop(scoop(hop(foo_foo, through = forest), up = field_mice), on = head)))\n```\n\nInstead, the code can be written using the pipe in the **order** in which the function is evaluated:\n\n```\nfoo_foo %>%\n   hop(through = forest) %>%\n       scoop(up = field_mice) %>%\n           bop(on = head)\n```\n\n**babynames**  Each year, the US Social Security Administration publishes a list of the most popular names given to babies.  In 2014, http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/#ht=2 shows Emma and Olivia leading for girls, Noah and Liam for boys.\n\nThe `babynames` data table in the `babynames` package comes from the Social Security Administration's listing of the names givens to babies in each year, and the number of babies of each sex given that name. (Only names with 5 or more babies are published by the SSA.)\n\n### Data Verbs (on single data frames)\n\n> Super important resource:  The RStudio **dplyr** cheat sheet: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf\n\n**Data verbs take data tables as input and give data tables as output (that's how we can use the chaining syntax!).**  We will use the R package **dplyr** to do much of our data wrangling.  Below is a list of verbs which will be helpful in wrangling many different types of data.  See the Data Wrangling cheat sheet from RStudio for additional help.   https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf\n\n * `sample_n()` take a random row(s)\n * `head()`  grab the first few rows\n * `tail()` grab the last few rows\n * `filter()`  removes unwanted *cases*\n *  `arrange()` reorders the cases\n *  `select()` removes unwanted *variables*   (and `rename()` )\n *  `distinct()` returns the unique values in a table\n * `mutate()` transforms the variable (and `transmute()` like mutate, returns only new variables)\n *  `group_by()` tells R that SUCCESSIVE functions keep in mind that there are groups of items.  So `group_by()` only makes sense with verbs later on (like `summarize()`).\n *  `summarize()`  collapses a data frame to a single row.  Some functions that are used within `summarize()` include:\n\n     * `min(), max(), mean(), sum(), sd(), median()`, and `IQR()`\n     * `n()`: number of observations in the current group\n     * `n_distinct(x)`: count the number of unique values in `x`\n     * `first_value(x), last_value(x)` and `nth_value(x, n)`: work similarly to `x[1], x[length(x)]`, and `x[n]` \n\n\n\n<!--\nThe following Shiny app (\"Visualizing data manipulation operations\") is for demonstrating how to work with dplyr/tidyr data manipulation.  It includes tabs for data selection, `filter` and `select`, `mutate`, `group_by` and `summarize`, `group_by` and `mutate`, and `join`.   http://rstudio.calvin.edu:3838/rpruim/dataOps/\n-->\n\n## R examples, basic verbs\n\n  \n### Datasets\n\n\n`starwars` is from **dplyr** , although originally from SWAPI, the Star Wars API, http://swapi.co/.\n\n`NHANES` From `?NHANES`:  NHANES is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960's. Since 1999 approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination component of the survey. The health examination is conducted in a mobile examination center (MEC).\n\n`babynames`  Each year, the US Social Security Administration publishes a list of the most popular names given to babies.

See the RStudio **dplyr** cheat sheet,  https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf}.\n\n\n* `pivot_longer` makes many columns into 2 columns: `pivot_longer(data, cols,  names_to = , value_to = )`\n* `pivot_wider` makes one column into multiple columns: `pivot_wider(data, names_from = , values_from = )`\n* `left_join` returns all rows from the left table, and any rows with matching keys from the right table.\n* `inner_join` returns only the rows in which the left table have matching keys in the right table (i.e., matching rows in both sets).\n* `full_join` returns all rows from both tables, join records from the left which have matching keys in the right table.\n\n\nGood practice:  always specify the `by` argument when joining data frames.\n\n![If you ever need to understand which join is the right join for you, try to find an image that will lay out what the function is doing.

In particular, **lubridate** makes it very easy to work with days, times, and dates.  The base idea is to start with dates in a `ymd` (year month day) format and transform the information into whatever you want.  The linked table is from the original paper and provides many of the basic **lubridate** commands:  http://blog.yhathq.com/static/pdf/R_date_cheat_sheet.pdf}.\n\nExample from  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html\n\n#### If anyone drove a time machine, they would crash\n\nThe length of months and years change so often that doing arithmetic with them can be unintuitive. Consider a simple operation, January 31st + one month. Should the answer be:\n\n\n1. February 31st (which doesn't exist)\n2. March 4th (31 days after January 31), or\n3. February 28th (assuming its not a leap year)\n\nA basic property of arithmetic is that a + b - b = a. Only solution 1 obeys the mathematical property, but it is an invalid date. Wickham wants to  make lubridate as consistent as possible by invoking the following rule: if adding or subtracting a month or a year creates an invalid date, lubridate will return an NA. \n\nIf you thought solution 2 or 3 was more useful, no problem. You can still get those results with clever arithmetic, or by using the special `%m+%` and `%m-%` operators. `%m+%` and `%m-%` automatically roll dates back to the last day of the month, should that be necessary.\n\n#### R examples, `lubridate()`\n\n##### Some basics in lubridate {-}\n\n\n```{r}\nrequire(lubridate)\nrightnow <- now()\n\nday(rightnow)\nweek(rightnow)\nmonth(rightnow, label=FALSE)\nmonth(rightnow, label=TRUE)\nyear(rightnow)\n\nminute(rightnow)\nhour(rightnow)\n\nyday(rightnow)\nmday(rightnow)\nwday(rightnow, label=FALSE)\nwday(rightnow, label=TRUE)\n```\n\n##### But how do I create a date object? {-}\n\n```{r}\njan31 <- ymd(\"2021-01-31\")\njan31 + months(0:11)\n\nfloor_date(jan31, \"month\") + months(0:11) + days(31)\njan31 + months(0:11) + days(31)\n\njan31 %m+% months(0:11)\n```\n\n\n##### NYC flights {-}\n```{r}\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nnames(flights)\nflightsWK <- flights %>% \n   mutate(ymdday = ymd(paste(year, month,day, sep=\"-\"))) %>%\n   mutate(weekdy = wday(ymdday, label=TRUE), \n          whichweek = week(ymdday))\n\nhead(flightsWK)\n\nflightsWK <- flights %>% \n   mutate(ymdday = ymd(paste(year,\"-\", month,\"-\",day))) %>%\n   mutate(weekdy = wday(ymdday, label=TRUE), whichweek = week(ymdday))\n\nflightsWK %>% select(year, month, day, ymdday, weekdy, whichweek, dep_time, \n                     arr_time, air_time) %>%  \n   head()\n```\n\n\n<!--\n## Scraping Data\n\nNeed to talk about this!

For example: \n\n* `map(.x, .f)` is the main mapping function and returns a list\n\n* `map_df(.x, .f)` returns a data frame\n\n* `map_dbl(.x, .f)` returns a numeric (double) vector\n\n* `map_chr(.x, .f)` returns a character vector\n\n* `map_lgl(.x, .f)` returns a logical vector\n\nNote that the first argument is always the data object and the second object is always the function you want to iteratively apply to each element in the input object.\n\nThe **input** to a `map` function is always either a *vector* (like a column), a *list* (which can be non-rectangular), or a *dataframe* (like a rectangle).\n\nA list is a way to hold things which might be very different in shape:\n\n```{r}\na_list <- list(a_number = 5,\n                      a_vector = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n                      a_dataframe = data.frame(a = 1:3, \n                                               b = c(\"q\", \"b\", \"z\"), \n                                               c = c(\"bananas\", \"are\", \"so very great\")))\n\nprint(a_list)\n```\n\n\nConsider the following function:\n\n```{r}\nadd_ten <- function(x) {\n  return(x + 10)\n  }\n```\n\nWe can `map()` the `add_ten()` function across a vector.  Note that the output is a list (the default).\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmap(.x = c(2, 5, 10),\n    .f = add_ten)\n```\n\nWhat if we use a different type of input?  The default behavior is to still return a list!\n\n```{r}\ndata.frame(a = 2, b = 5, c = 10) %>%\n  map(add_ten)\n```\n\nWhat if we want a different type of output?  We use a different `map()` function, `map_df()`, for example.\n\n```{r}\ndata.frame(a = 2, b = 5, c = 10) %>%\n  map_df(add_ten)\n```\n\n\nShorthand lets us get away from pre-defining the function (which will be useful).  Use the tilde `~` to indicate that you have a function: \n\n```{r}\ndata.frame(a = 2, b = 5, c = 10) %>%\n  map_df(~{.x + 10})\n```\n\nMostly, the tilde will be used for functions we already know:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(broom)\n\npenguins %>%\n  split(.$species) %>%\n  map(~ lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = .x)) %>%\n  map_df(tidy)  # map(tidy)\n\npenguins %>%\n  group_by(species) %>%\n  group_map(~lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = .x)) %>%\n  map(tidy)  # map_df(tidy)\n```\n\n## `reprex()`\n\n> Help me help you\n\nIn order to create a `repr`oducible `ex`ample ...\n\nStep 1.  Copy code onto the clipboard\n\nStep 2.  Type `reprex()` into the Console\n\nStep 3.  Look at the Viewer to the right.  Copy the Viewer output into GitHub, Piazza, an email, stackexchange, etc.\n\n\nSome places to learn more about `reprex` include\n\n* A blog about it: https://teachdatascience.com/reprex/\n* The `reprex` vignette: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html\n* `reprex` dos and donts: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html\n* Jenny Bryan webinar on `reprex`: \"Help me help you.
