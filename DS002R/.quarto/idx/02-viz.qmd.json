Computational statistics and data science sometimes focus on models or resulting predictions from the models.  But there is no doubt that the structure and format of the data are the key to whether or not a model is appropriate or good.  A good data analyst will always spend a lot of time and effort on exploratory data analysis, much of which includes making as many visualizations of the data as possible.\n\n```{r, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, \n                      fig.height=3, fig.width=5,  \n                      cache=TRUE, fig.align = \"center\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n\n\nDepending on the introductory (or other) statistics classes you've had, your instructor may have focused more or less on visualizations in class.  They (I) may have even said something like *making visualizations are incredibly important to the entire data analysis process.*  But even if you buy the perspective, why is it that we don't see more good graphics in our analyses?   Andrew Gelman [@Gelman11] responds by stating, \"Good statistical graphics are hard to do, much harder than running regressions and making tables.\"   **Our goal will be to create graphics and visualizations that convey statistical information.**\n\nNolan [@Nolan16] describes three important ways that graphics can be used to convey statistical information.  The \"guiding principles\" will be used as a way of evaluating others' figures as well as a metric for creating our own visualizations to help with statistical analysis.\n\n1.  *Make the data stand out* \n\nThe important idea here is to find anything unusual in the data.  Are there patterns?  Outliers?  What are the bounds of the variables?  How should the axes be scaled?  Are transformations warranted?   \n\n2. *Facilitate comparison*\n\nThe second item allows us to consider the research questions at hand. What are the important variables?  How do we emphasize them?  Which variables should be plotted together?  Can they be super-imposed?  Does color, plotting character, size of plot character help to bring out the important relationships?  Be aware of over plotting and issues of color blindness. http://colorbrewer2.org/\n\n3. *Add information*\n\nPlots should also add context to the comparison.  Figure legends, axes scales, and reference markers (e.g., a line at $y=x$) go a long way toward helping the reader understand your message.  Captions should be self-contained (and not assume the user has also read your text) and descriptive; they should summarize the content of the figure and the conclusion related to the message you want to convey.\n\n\nRandy Pruim asks the following question to decide whether or not a plot is good:  *Does my plot make the comparisons I am interested in...*\n\n* easily? and\n* accurately?\n\nConsider adding alt text to allow screen readers to parse the image.  The DataViz Society/Nightingale by way of Amy Cesal has an article on writing good alt text for plots/graphs, <a href = \"https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81\" target = \"_blank\">Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization</a>.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe first two examples are taken from a book by Edward Tufte who is arguably the master at visualizations.  The book is *Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making decisions*.  The book can be purchased at http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb, though there may be online versions of it that you can download. \n\n\n##### An aside {-}\nGenerally, the better your graphics are, the better able you will be to communicate ideas broadly (that's how you become rich and famous).  By graphics I mean not only figures associated with analyses, but also power point presentations, posters, and information on your website provided for other scientists who might be interested in your work.  Tufte is a master at understanding how to convey information visually, and I strongly recommend you look at his work.  Start with Wikipedia where some of his main ideas are provided (e.g., \"data-ink ratio\") and then check out his incredible texts.  I have many of them in my office and am happy to let you peruse them. http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi\n\n\nAs mentioned in the booklet we are using, there are two main motivational steps to working with graphics as part of an argument [@Tufte97].\n\n1. \"An essential analytic task in making decisions based on evidence is to understand how things work.\"\n2. Making decisions based on evidence requires the appropriate display of that evidence.\"\n\nBack to the examples... \n\n### Cholera via Tufte\n\nIn September 1854, the worst outbreak of cholera in London occurred in a few block radius - within 10 days, there were more than 500 fatalities.  John Snow recognized the clumping of deaths, and hypothesized that they were due to contamination of the Broad Street water pump.  Despite testing the water from the pump and finding no suspicious impurities, he did notice that the water quality varies from data to day.  More importantly, there seemed to be no other possible causal mechanism for the outbreak.  Eight days after the outbreak began, Snow described his findings to the authorities, and the Board of Guardians of St. James's Parish ordered the Broad Street pump handle removed.  The epidemic ended soon after. \n\n*Why was John Snow successful at solving the problem?*  Some thoughts to consider (as reported in @Tufte97):\n\n1. The bacterium *Vibrio cholerae* was not discovered until 1886, however Snow had myriad experience both as a medical doctor and in looking at patterns of of other outbreaks.  He was the first to realized that cholera was transmitted through water instead of by air or other means.\n\n2. **Data in Context**  Snow thought carefully about how to present the data.  Instead of simply looking at the data as counts or frequencies, he looked at the death *spatially* - on a map of the area.\n\n3. **Comparisons**  In order to isolate the pump as the *cause* of the outbreak, Snow needed to understand how the individuals who had died were different than the individuals who had survived.  Snow found two other groups of individuals (brewers who drank only beer, and employees at a work house who had an on-site pump) who had not succumbed to the disease.\n\n4. **Alternatives**  Whenever a theory is present, it is vitally important to contrast the theory against all possible alternative possibilities.  In Snow's case, he needed to consider all individuals who did not regularly use the Broad Street pump - he was able to understand the exceptions in every case.\n\n5. Did removing the pump handle really *cause* the outbreak to cease?  Wasn't it already on the decline?\n\n6. **Assessment of the Graphic**  Did the individuals die at the place on the map?  Live at the place on the map? Which (types of) individuals were missing from the graph?  Missing at random?  What decisions did he make in creating the graph (axes, binning of histogram bars, time over which data are plotted, etc.) that change the story needing to be told?\n\n\n\n### Challenger via Tufte\n\nJohn Snow's story of the successful graphical intervention in the cholera outbreak is contrasted with the fateful poor-graphical non-intervention of the Challenger disaster.  On January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger took off from Cape Canaveral, FL and immediately exploded, killing all seven astronauts aboard.  We now know that the reason for the explosion was due to the failure of two rubber O-rings which malfunctioned due to the cold temperature of the day ($\\sim 29^\\circ$ F).   \n\nUnlike the cholera epidemic, those who understood the liability of a shuttle launch under cold conditions were unable to convince the powers that be to postpone the launch (there was much political momentum going forward to get the shuttle off the ground, including the first teacher in space, Christa McAuliffe).  As seen in the Tufte chapter, the evidence was clear but not *communicated*! \n\nThe biggest problem (existing in many of the bullet points below) is that the engineers failed to as the important question about the data: **in relation to what??**\n\n1. The engineers who understood the problem created tables and engineering graphs which were\n     (a) Not visually appealing.\n     (b) Not decipherable to the layman (e.g., \"At about $50^\\circ$ F blow-by could be experienced in case joints\")\n     (c) There was also no authorship (reproducibility!).  **Figures should always have both accountability and reproducibility.**\n\n2. The information provided included very relevant points (about temperature) and superfluous information unrelated to temperature.  The univariate analysis was insufficient because the story the data were trying to tell was about the **bivariate relationship between temperature and o-ring failure**.\n\n3. Missing data created an illusion of *lack of evidence*, when in fact, the true story was quite strong given the full set of information.  (92% of the temperature data was missing from some of the most vital tables.)\n\n4. Anecdotal evidence was misconstrued:  SRM-15 at 57F had the most damage, but SRM-22 at 75F had the second most damage.\n\n5. In the end, the shuttle launched on a day which was an extrapolation from the model suggested by the data.  They had never launched a shuttle at temperatures of $26^\\circ-29^\\circ$F.\n\n6. Tufte goes on to describe many ways which the final presentation by the engineers to the administrators was inadequate:  disappearing legend (labels), chartjunk, lack of clarity depicting cause and effect, and wrong order.\n\nAs with the cholera outbreak, a persuasive argument could have been made if the visualizations had\n\n(1) been in context *plot data versus temperature not time!*, \n(2) used appropriate comparisons: *as compared with what?*, \n(3) consider alternative scenarios *when else did O-rings fail?  What is the science behind O-ring failure?*, and \n(4) the graphics had been assessed *what is all of the extra noise?  are the words being used accessible to non-engineers?*. \n\nTufte [@Tufte97] created the graphic below which should have been used before the launch to convince others to postpone.  As you can see, the graphic is extremely convincing.  An aside: the O-ring data are well suited for an analysis using logistic regression.  Today, most scientists believe that the temperature *caused* the O-ring failure, however, the data do not speak to the causal relationship because they were not collected using a randomized experiment.  That is, there could have been other confounding variables (e.g., humidity) which were possible causal mechanisms.\n\n\n```{r fig.cap = \"The graphic the engineers should have led with in trying to persuade the administrators not to launch.  It is evident that the number of O-ring failures is quite highly associated with the ambient temperature.  Note the *vital* information on the x-axis associated with the large number of launches at warm temperatures that had *zero* O-ring failures.

We try to model the process of creating visualizations in the course by dedicating class time to an iterative creation of a plot. We begin either with a plot that screams for correction, and we transform it step-by-step, always thinking about the goal of a graph that is data rich and presents a clear vision of the important features of the data.\n\n### An example from Information is Beautiful\n\n(See HW2 for details on R code)\n\nConsider the plot at http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/caffeine-and-calories/.  Note that the origin is at the point (150,150).  While we can get over the hurdle, it is not what is expected when looking at a graph.\n\n\n```{r fig.cap = \"http://infobeautiful3.s3.amazonaws.com/2013/01/1276_buzz_v_bulge.png\", fig.width = 7, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/buzzvbulge.png\")\n```\n\nI have removed the vertical and horizontal lines which detracted from the idea of an origin.  I have also added additional information (color) to describe the chain from which the drink comes from.  Notice that an additional difference between my plot and the original plot is that I have many more observations.\n\n\n```{r fig.cap = \"Calories and Caffeine for drinks from various drinks and other items.  Data source is: World Cancer Research Fund, Starbucks Beverage Nutrition Guide, Calorie Counter Database.  Seemingly, the observational units (rows) are not a random sample of anything.  As such, we should be careful of summarizing the data in any way - what would the 'average' calories even mean?  Note, from the entire dataset give, the average calories is 179.8 and the average caffeine is 134.43.

Instead we now think in glyphs (geoms), and so we can put whatever we want on the plot.  Note also that the transition leads you from a passive consumer (I need to make plot XXX because everyone else does, so I just plug in the data) into an active participant (what do I want my data to say?  and how can I put that information onto my graphic?)\n\nThe most important questions you can ask with respect to creating figures are:\n\n1. What do we want R to do? (What is the goal?)\n2. What does R need to know?\n\n@Yau gives us nine visual cues, and @Wickham14 translates them into a language using `ggplot2`.  (The items below are from @MDSR, chapter 2.)\n\n\n1. Visual Cues:  the aspects of the figure where we should focus.  \n**Position** (numerical) where in relation to other things?  \n**Length** (numerical) how big (in one dimension)?  \n**Angle** (numerical) how wide? parallel to something else?  \n**Direction** (numerical) at what slope?  In a time series, going up or down?  \n**Shape** (categorical) belonging to what group?  \n**Area** (numerical) how big (in two dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  \n**Volume** (numerical) how big (in three dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  \n**Shade** (either) to what extent?  how severely?  \n**Color** (either) to what extent? how severely? Beware of red/green color blindness.  \n\n2. Coordinate System: rectangular, polar, geographic, etc.\n\n3. Scale: numeric (linear? logarithmic?), categorical (ordered?), time\n\n4.

So all the dots get set to the same color, but it's not navy.\n\n##### Setting vs. Mapping {-}\n\n\nIf we want to *set* the color to be navy for all of the dots, we do it outside the aesthetic, without a dataset variable:\n\n```{r}\nBirths78 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births)) +   # map x & y \n  geom_point(color = \"navy\")   +     # set color\n  ggtitle(\"US Births in 1978\")\n```\n\n* Note that `color = \"navy\"` is now outside of the aesthetics list.  That's how `ggplot2` distinguishes between mapping and setting.\n\n\n##### How can we make the plot? {-}\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nBirths78 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births)) + \n  geom_line(aes(color=wday)) +        # map color here\n  geom_point(color=\"navy\")    +        # set color here\n  ggtitle(\"US Births in 1978\")\n```\n\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nBirths78 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births)) + \n  geom_line(aes(color=wday)) +       # map color here\n  geom_point(color=\"navy\") +          # set color here\n  ggtitle(\"US Births in 1978\")\n```\n\n* `ggplot()` establishes the default data and aesthetics for the geoms, but each geom may change the defaults.\n\n* good practice: put into `ggplot()` the things that affect all (or most) of the layers; rest in `geom_blah()`\n\n##### Setting vs. Mapping (again) {-}\n\nInformation gets passed to the plot via:\n\na. `map` the **variable** information inside the aes (aesthetic) command\n\na. `set` the **non-variable** information outside the aes (aesthetic) command\n\n##### Other geoms {-}\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}\napropos(\"^geom_\")\n```\n\nhelp pages will tell you their aesthetics, default stats, etc.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n?geom_area             # for example\n```\n\n\n##### Let's try `geom_area` {-}\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nBirths78 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births, fill=wday)) + \n  geom_area()+\n  ggtitle(\"US Births in 1978\")\n```\n\nUsing area does not produce a good plot\n\n* over plotting is hiding much of the data\n* extending y-axis to 0 may or may not be desirable.\n\n##### Side note: what makes a plot good? {-}\n\nMost (all?) graphics are intended to help us make comparisons\n\n* How does something change over time?\n* Do my treatments matter?  How much?\n* Do men and women respond the same way?\n\n**Key plot metric:** Does my plot make the comparisons I am interested in \n\n* easily, and \n* accurately?\n\n##### Time for some different data {-}\n\n\n`HELPrct`: Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care randomized clinical trial\n\n```{r}\nhead(HELPrct)\n```\n\nSubjects admitted for treatment for addiction to one of three substances.\n\n##### Who are the people in the study? {-}\n\n\n```{r}\nHELPrct %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=substance)) + \n  geom_bar()+\n  ggtitle(\"HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit\")\n```\n\n* Hmm.  What's up with `y`?\n\n    * `stat_bin()` is being applied to the data before the \n    `geom_bar()` gets to do its thing.
