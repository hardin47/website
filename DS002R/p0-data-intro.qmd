# Introduction to data science {#sec-intro .unnumbered}

Databases are a powerful structure for holding huge amounts of data that can easily be accessed.  Databases are made up of tables which are efficiently stored using indexing and avoiding unnecessary replication of information.

@sec-db covers details of databases and reviews **R** functionality (mostly through the **dplyr** package) for working with data frames that mimics **SQL** queries for working with tables.

@sec-sql-R covers three different ways to run **SQL** queries in **R**. **R** code can be translated into **SQL**; the **DBI** package can send **SQL** queries through an `r` chunk; and **SQL** queries can be sent directly to a **SQL** server through a `sql` chunk.  Additionally, DBeaver is introduced as a **SQL** client which supports **MySQL**.
