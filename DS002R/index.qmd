Daily class notes for Foundations of Data Science in R, by Jo Hardin, DS002R at Pomona College.  Built on <a href = "https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/" target = "_blank">Modern Data Science with R</a> by Baumer, Kaplan, and Horton, 3rd ed. and <a href = "https://r4ds.hadley.nz/" target = "_blank">R for Data Science</a> by Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund, 2nd ed.

You are responsible for reading your texts. They are both free, excellent, and readable, so you should use them. That said, you should also make sure you are coming to class and asking lots of questions.

More information and course details can be found at the <a href = "https://ds002r-fds.netlify.app/" target = "_blank">DS002R website</a>.
