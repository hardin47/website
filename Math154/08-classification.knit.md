that f is a meaningful reflection of the true unknown process.


One of the most satisfying aspects of this unit is that you can now turn students loose on a massive data set. Past instances of the KDD Cup \url{http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php} are an excellent source for such data sets. We explored data from the 2008 KDD Cup on breast cancer. Each of the n observations contained digitized data from an X-Ray image of a breast. Each observation corresponded to a small area of a particular breast, which may or may not depict a malignant tumor ï¿œï¿œthis provided the binary response variable.  In addition to a handful of well-defined variables ((x, y)-location, etc.), each observation has 117 nameless attributes, about which no information was provided. Knowing nothing about what these variables mean, students recognized the need to employ machine learning techniques to sift through them and find relationships. The size of the data and number of variables made manual exploration of the data impractical.
