<p>The Georgia Department of Health came out with a grouped barplot showing the number of COVID-19 cases by day in 5 populous counties in GA. The bars were arranged in some kind of decreasing order, but at first glance, the typical reader will think that time is increasing along the x-axis.</p>

<p>Seems odd that a linear model was fit to these data.
In particular, the trend is absolutely non-linear!
Note that the screen shot has a slider to indicate the number of days modeled and displayed.
There is some information in 14, 28, and 42 days related to policy decisions based on whether cases are trending positive or negative.
However, even if you do need to know about positive or negative trends, even over a short time frame, the linear model fit to the data seems to be inappropriate.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 1929 RA Fisher said the following (and thus 0.05 was born):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
…An observation is judged significant, if it would rarely have been produced, in the absence of a real cause of the kind we are seeking.
<p style="color:red">
It is a common practice to judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that it would have been produced by chance not more frequently than once in twenty trials. This is an arbitrary, but convenient, level of significance for the practical investigator, but it does not mean that he allows himself to be deceived once in every twenty experiments. The test of significance only tells him what to ignore, namely all experiments in which significant results are not obtained.
</p>
<p>He should only claim that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when he knows how to design an experiment so that it will rarely fail to give a significant result. Consequently, isolated significant results which he does not know how to reproduce are left in suspense pending further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the Fisher is telling us that studies with p-values above 0.05 are not worth pursuing. He is <em>not</em> saying the studies with p-values less than 0.05 establish any sort of truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2014 George Cobb (Amherst College) posed the following questions:</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Why do so many colleges and grad schools teach p = .05?</p>
<p>A: Because that’s still what the scientific community and journal editors use.</p>
<p>Q: Why do so many people still use p = 0.05?</p>
<p>A: Because that’s what they were taught in college or grad school.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2015, <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em> banned all NHSTP (null hypothesis significance testing procedures) from scientific articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the implications for authors?

<p>Question 3. Are any inferential statistical procedures required?</p>
<p>Answer to Question 3. No, because the state of the art remains uncertain. However, BASP will require strong descriptive statistics, including effect sizes. We also encourage the presentation of frequency or distributional data when this is feasible. Finally, we encourage the use of larger sample sizes than is typical in much psychology research, because as the sample size increases, descriptive statistics become increasingly stable and sampling error is less of a problem. However, we will stop short of requiring particular sample sizes, because it is possible to imagine circumstances where more typical sample sizes might be justifiable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people think CIs are far superior to p-values. Not only can you assess significance, but you can also assess effect size. Here is a video that makes clear the comparison between a p-value and a confidence interval:</li>

<li>In 2016, the American Statistical Association came out with a statement on p-values <a href="http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108" class="uri">http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108</a>. The 6 main tenants of the statement are:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.</p></li>
<li><p>P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p- value passes a specific threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.</p></li>
<li><p>A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.</p></li>
<li><p>By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.</p></li>

<span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Human Subjects Research<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#human-subjects-research"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many ways to learn about federal regulations on studying human subjects. Any study that goes through an academic institution must be approved by the institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB); each of the Claremont Colleges has an IRB. Some of you may be familiar with HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) which is United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. HIPPA is also the legislation that keeps your academic records private.</p>
<p>Training in IRB policies can be found by Citi Program here: <a href="https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/human-subjects-research-hsr/" class="uri">https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/human-subjects-research-hsr/</a></p>
<p>Consider the following article: Cami Gearhart, “IRB Review of the Use of
Social Media in Research,” <strong>Monitor</strong>, 2012. <a href="https://www.quorumreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IRB-Review-of-the-Use-of-Social-Media-in-Research_Gearhart_Quorum-Review_Monitor_2012_12_01.pdf" class="uri">https://www.quorumreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IRB-Review-of-the-Use-of-Social-Media-in-Research_Gearhart_Quorum-Review_Monitor_2012_12_01.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of interactive social media to collect information during study recruitment raises additional issues under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule prohibits the collection of an individual?s personal health information (or PHI) by a covered entity without prior written authorization from that individual.18 As PHI includes an individual?s contact information, including name, age, e-mail address, and mailing address, the Privacy Rule prohibits the collection of contact information via a website without prior authorization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This rule creates a conundrum when using social media, as it may be impractical to obtain a written authorization prior to collecting contact information during the recruitment process. To get around this restriction, a researcher generally must obtain a partial waiver of the HIPAA authorization requirement. (A waiver in this situation is considered “partial” because it is needed only for the recruitment phase of the clinical study.) A researcher can apply to either an IRB or a privacy board for such a waiver; the researcher will be asked to explain why it is impractical to obtain written authorizations, the plan for collecting information, and the planned safeguards for the data.</p>

<h4>OKCupid<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#okcupid"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Consider a study done on a dataset of nearly 70,000 users of the online dating site OkCupid (including usernames, age, gender, location, relationship interests, personality traits, and many other profile variables). The authors did not violate any technical policies such as breaking passwords. However, their work indicates a violation of privacy ethics as indicated by HIPPA and use of IRBs.

<p>We could spend days talking about bias in algorithms. The take away from the examples below is that the data that is used to <em>train</em> the model can have huge effects on the creation of the model. A fantastic book on the issue is <strong>Weapons of Math Destruction</strong> by Cathy O’Neil. A podcast about the book is at: <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-age-of-the-algorithm/" class="uri">https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-age-of-the-algorithm/</a>.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the various laws which are designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. Just because you didn’t try to build an algorithm that is biased against a protected group does not mean that you are off the hook. There are two ways that laws are enforced (both equally important):</p>

<p>In this talk, Mike Williams, Research Engineer at Fast Forward Labs, looks at how supervised machine learning has the potential to amplify power and privilege in society. Using sentiment analysis, he demonstrates how text analytics often favors the voices of men. Mike discusses how bias can inadvertently be introduced into any model, and how to recognize and mitigate these harms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There isn’t an option which is objective and fair. That option doesn’t exist… The whole premise is based on bias in your training set. If there are no biases, there are no patterns in your training set. Then the system is not going to work… Supervised machine learning, when it goes really well, when you do a really good job, reproduces the biases in the training data.</p>

<p>The ethical statistician uses methodology and data that are relevant and appropriate, without favoritism or prejudice, and in a manner intended to produce valid, interpretable, and reproducible results. The ethical statistician does not knowingly accept work for which they are not sufficiently qualified, is honest with the client about any limitation of expertise, and consults other statisticians when necessary or in doubt.</p>

<h4>Integrity of Data and Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#integrity-of-data-and-methods"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The ethical statistician is candid about any known or suspected limitations, defects, or biases in the data that may impact the integrity or reliability of the statistical analysis. Objective and valid interpretation of the results requires that the underlying analysis recognizes and acknowledges the degree of reliability and integrity of the data.</p>

<p>The practice of statistics requires consideration of the entire range of possible explanations for observed phenomena, and distinct observers drawing on their own unique sets of experiences can arrive at different and potentially diverging judgments about the plausibility of different explanations.
