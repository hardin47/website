# Class Information {-}

Class notes for Math 154 at Pomona College: Computational Statistics.  The notes are based extensively on An Introduction to Statistical Learning [@ISL] by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshiran;  Modern Data Science [@MDSR] with R by Baumer, Kaplan, and Horton; Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving [@DSR] by Nolan and Temple Lang; and Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions [@VST] by Tufte.  The computing part of the class will be taken from R for Data Science [@r4ds] by Wickham and Grolemund as well as Tidy Modeling with R [@tidymodels] by Kuhn and Silge.
