Daily class notes for Computational Statistics, by Jo Hardin, Math 154 at Pomona College.  Built on <a href = "https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/" target = "_blank">Modern Data Science with R</a> by Baumer, Kaplan, and Horton, 3rd ed. and <a href = "https://www.statlearning.com/" target = "_blank">An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a> by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, 2nd ed.

You are responsible for reading your texts. They are both free, excellent, and readable, so you should use them. That said, you should also make sure you are coming to class and asking lots of questions.

More information and course details can be found at the <a href = "https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/" target = "_blank">Math 154 website</a>.
