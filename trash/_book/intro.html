<p><strong>What is Statistics?</strong>
Generally, statistics is the academic discipline which uses data to make claims and predictions about larger populations of interest. It is the science of collecting, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing data as a representation of a larger whole. It is worth noting that probability represents the majority of mathematical tools used in statistics, but probability as a discipline does not work with data. Having taken a probability class may help you with some of the mathematics covered in the course, but it is not a substitute for understanding the basics of introductory statistics.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>descriptive statistics</em> describe the sample at hand with no intent on making generalizations.</li>
<li>
<em>inferential statistics</em> use a sample to make claims about a population</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the content of Math 154?</strong>
This class will be an introduction to statistical methods that rely heavily on the use of computers. The course will generally have three parts. The first section will include communicating and working with data in a modern era. This includes data wrangling, data visualization, data ethics, and collaborative research (via GitHub). The second part of the course will focus on traditional statistical inference done through computational methods (e.g., permutation tests, bootstrapping, and regression smoothers). The last part of the course will focus on machine learning ideas such as classification, clustering, and dimension reduction techniques. Some of the methods were invented before the ubiquitous use of personal computers, but only because the calculus used to solve the problem was relatively straightforward (or because the method wasn’t actually every used). Some of the methods have been developed within the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>Who should take Math 154?</strong>
Computational Statistics will cover many of the concepts and tools for modern data analysis, and therefore the ideas are important for people who would like to do modern data analysis. Some individuals may want to go to graduate school in statistics or data science, some may hope to become data scientists without additional graduate work, and some may hope to use modern techniques in other disciplines (e.g., computational biology, environmental analysis, or political science). All of these groups of individuals will get a lot out of Computational Statistics as they turn to analyzing their own data. Computational Statistics is not, however, a course which is necessary for entry into graduate school in statistics, mathematics, data science, or computer science.</p>
<p><strong>What are the prerequisites for Math 154?</strong>
Computational Statistics requires a strong background in both statistics as well as algorithmic thinking. The formal prerequisite is any introductory statistics course, but if you have had only AP Statistics, you may find yourself working very hard in the first few weeks of the class to catch up. If you have taken a lot of mathematics, there are parts of the course that will come easily to you. However, a mathematics degree is not a substitute for introductory statistics, and if you have not taken introductory statistics, the majority of the course work will not be intuitive for you. You must have taken a prior statistics course as a pre-requisite to Math 154; a computer science course is also recommended.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that probability represents the majority of mathematical tools used in statistics, but probability as a discipline does not work with data. Having taken a probability class may help you with some of the mathematics covered in the course, but it is not a substitute for understanding the basics of introductory statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Is there overlap with other classes?</strong>
There are many machine learning and data science courses at the 5Cs which overlap with Math 154. Those courses continue to be developed and change, so I cannot speak to all of them. Generally, the Data Science courses taught in other 5C math departments focus slightly more on the mathematics of the tools (e.g., mathematically breaking down sparse matrices) and the Machine Learning courses taught in 5C CS departments focus on the programming aspects of the tools (e.g., how to code a Random Forest). Our focus will be on the inferential aspect of the tools, that is, what do the results say about the larger problem which we are trying to solve? How can we know the results are accurate? What are the sources of variability?</p>
<p><strong>When should I take Math 154?</strong>
While the prerequisite for Computational Statistics is Introduction to Statistics, the course moves very quickly and covers a tremendous amount of material. It is not ideally suited for a first year student coming straight out of AP Statistics. Instead, that student should focus on taking more mathematics, CS, interdisciplinary science, or other statistics courses. Most students taking Computational Statistics are juniors and seniors.</p>
<p><strong>What is the workload for Math 154?</strong>
There is one homework assignment per week, two in-class midterm exams, two take-home midterm exams, and a final end of the semester project. Many students report working about 8-10 hours per week on this class.</p>
<p><strong>What software will we use? Will there be any real world applications? Will there be any mathematics? Will there be any CS?</strong>
All of the work will be done in R (using RStudio as a front end, called an integrated development environment, IDE). You will need to either download R and RStudio (both are free) onto your own computer or use them on Pomona’s server. All assignments will be posted to private repositories on GitHub. The class is a mix of many real world applications and case studies, some higher level math, programming, and communication skills. The final project requires your own analysis of a dataset of your choosing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may use R on the Pomona server: <a href="https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/" class="uri">https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/</a> (All Pomona students will be able to log in immediately. Non-Pomona students need to go to ITS at Pomona to get Pomona login information.)</li>
<li>If you want to use R on your own machine, you may. Please make sure all components are updated:
R is freely available at <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" class="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</a> and is already installed on college computers. Additionally, installing R Studio is required <a href="http://rstudio.org/" class="uri">http://rstudio.org/</a>.</li>
<li>All assignments should be turned in using R Markdown compiled to pdf.</li>

<p>Computational Statistics can be a very large umbrella for many ideas. Indeed, sometimes the topics can seem somewhat disjointed. Below, I’ve categorized the topics we will cover into four groups. The four different broad topics all play different roles and can be more or less important depending on the problem at hand. None of the topics should exist on their own, because only with the bigger focus on all topics will any sort of data analysis / interpretation be accurate and compelling.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this course was to convince students that there are two major kinds of skills one must have in order to be a successful data scientist: technical skills to actually do the analyses; and communication skills in order to present one’s findings to a presumably non-technical audience. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Baumer15" role="doc-biblioref">Baumer 2015</a>)</span></p>

<p>(Below are some very good thoughts on the DS Process, but you are not responsible for any of the content in this section.)</p>
<p>Duncan Temple Lang, University of California, Davis</p>
<p>Duncan Temple-Lang is a leader in the area of combining computer science research concepts within the context of statistics and science more generally. Recently, he was invited to participate in a workshop, <em>Training Students to Extract Value from Big Data</em>. The workshop was subsequently summarized in a manuscript of the same name and has been provided free of charge. <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18981" class="uri">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18981</a> [National Research Council. <em>Training Students to Extract Value from Big Data: Summary of a Workshop</em>. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2014.]</p>
<p>Duncan Temple Lang began by listing the core concepts of data science - items that will need to be taught: statistics and machine learning, computing and technologies, and domain knowledge of each problem. He stressed the importance of interpretation and reasoning - not only methods - in addressing data. Students who work in data science will have to have a broad set of skills - including knowledge of randomness and uncertainty, statistical methods, programming, and technology - and practical experience in them. Students tend to have had few computing and statistics classes on entering graduate school in a domain science.</p>
<p>Temple Lang then described the data analysis pipeline, outlining the steps in one example of a data analysis and exploration process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Asking a general question.</li>
<li>Refining the question, identifying data, and understanding data and metadata. Temple Lang noted that the data used are usually not collected for the specific question at hand, so the original experiment and data set should be understood.</li>
<li>Access to data. This is unrelated to the science but does require computational skill.</li>
<li>Transforming to data structures.</li>
<li>Exploratory data analyses to understand the data and determine whether the results will scale.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a critical step; Temple Lang noted that 80 percent of a data scientist’s time can be spent in cleaning and preparing the data.
6. Dimension reduction. Temple Lang stressed that it can be difficult or impossible to automate this step.
7. Modeling and estimation. Temple Lang noted that computer and machine learning scientists tend to focus more on predictive models than on modeling of physical behavior or characteristics.
8. Diagnostics. This helps to understand how well the model fits the data and identifies
anomalies and aspects for further study. This step has similarities to exploratory data analysis.
9. Quantifying uncertainty. Temple Lang indicated that quantifying uncertainty with statistical techniques is important for understanding and interpreting models and results.
10. Conveying results.</p>
<p>Temple Lang stressed that the data analysis process is highly interactive and iterative and requires the presence of a human in the loop. The next step in data processing is often not clear until the results of the current step are clear, and often something unexpected is uncovered. He also emphasized the importance of abstract skills and concepts and said that people need to be exposed to authentic data analyses, not only to the methods used. Data scientists also need to have a statistical understanding, and Temple Lang described the statistical concepts that should be taught to a student:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping the general question to a statistical framework.</li>
<li>Understanding the scope of inference, sampling, biases, and limitations.</li>
<li>Exploratory data analyses, including missing values, data quality, cleaning, matching, and fusing.</li>
<li>Understanding randomness, variability, and uncertainty. Temple Lang noted that many
students do not understand sampling variability.</li>
<li>Conditional dependence and heterogeneity.</li>
<li>Dimension reduction, variable selection, and sparsity.</li>
<li>Spurious relationships and multiple testing.</li>
<li>Parameter estimation versus “black box” prediction and classification.</li>
<li>Diagnostics, residuals, and comparing models.</li>
<li>Quantifying the uncertainty of a model.</li>
<li>Sampling structure and dependence for data reduction. Temple Lang noted that modeling of data becomes complicated when variables are not independent, identically distributed.</li>
<li>Statistical accuracy versus computational complexity and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Temple Lang then briefly discussed some of the practical aspects of computing, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing data.</li>
<li>Manipulating raw data.</li>
<li>Data structures and storage, including correlated data.</li>
<li>Visualization at all stages (particularly in exploratory data analyses and conveying the results).</li>
<li>Parallel computing, which can be challenging for a new student.</li>
<li>Translating high-level descriptions to optimal programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the discussion, Temple Lang proposed computing statistics on visualizations to examine data rigorously in a statistical and automated way. He explained that “scagnostics” (from scatter plot diagnostics) is a data analysis technique for graphically exploring the relationships among variables. A small set of statistical measures can characterize scatter plots, and exploratory data analysis can be conducted on the residuals. [More information about scagnostics can be found in (Wilkinson et al., 2005, 2006).]</p>
<p>A workshop participant noted the difference between a data error and a data blunder. A blunder is a large, easily noticeable mistake. The participant gave the example of shipboard observations of cloud cover; blunders, in that case, occur when the location of the ship observation is given to be on land rather than at sea. Another blunder would be a case of a ship’s changing location too quickly. The participant speculated that such blunders could be generalized to detect problematic observations, although the tools would need to be scalable to be applied to large data sets.</p>

<p>My analysis, shown below, concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways. What’s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a year of new data, with over 2700 more tweets. And quite notably, Trump stopped using the Android in March 2017. This is why machine learning approaches like <a href="http://didtrumptweetit.com/" class="uri">http://didtrumptweetit.com/</a> are useful, since they can still distinguish Trump’s tweets from his campaign’s by training on the kinds of features I used in my original post.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found a better dataset: in my original analysis, I was working quickly and used the <code>twitteR</code> package (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/</a>) to query Trump’s tweets. I since learned there’s a bug in the package that caused it to retrieve only about half the tweets that could have been retrieved, and in any case I was able to go back only to January 2016. I’ve since found the truly excellent Trump Twitter Archive (<a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/" class="uri">http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/</a>), which contains all of Trump’s tweets going back to 2009. Below I show some R code for querying it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard some interesting questions that I wanted to follow up on: These come from the comments on the original post and other conversations I’ve had since. Two questions included what device Trump tended to use before the campaign, and what types of tweets tended to lead to high engagement.</p>
